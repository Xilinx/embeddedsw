* @file sleep.c
*
* This function supports user configurable sleep implementation.
* This provides delay in seconds by using the Timer specified by
* the user in the ARM Cortex R5 MP core.
*
* <pre>
* MODIFICATION HISTORY:
*
* Ver   Who      Date     Changes
* ----- -------- -------- -----------------------------------------------
* 5.00 	pkp  	 02/20/14 First release
* 5.04  pkp		 02/19/16 sleep routine is modified to use TTC3 if present
*						  else it will use set of assembly instructions to
*						  provide the required delay
* 5.04	pkp		 03/09/16 Assembly routine for sleep is modified to avoid
*						  disabling the interrupt
* 5.04	pkp		 03/11/16 Compare the counter value to previously read value
*						  to detect the overflow for TTC3
* 6.0   asa      08/15/16 Updated the sleep signature. Fix for CR#956899.
* 6.6	srm      10/18/17 Updated sleep routines to support user configurable
*			  implementation. Now sleep routines will use TTC
*                         instance specified by user.
* 7.2   mus      01/29/20 Updated sleep routines to use CortexR5 PMU for delay
*                         generation, in case TTC3/TTC2 instances are not
*                         present in HW design. If user dont want to use PMU
*                         counter for sleep routines, BSP needs to be compiled
*                         with "DONT_USE_PMU_FOR_SLEEP_ROUTINES" flag. It fixes
*                         CR#1051591.

*
* @note		By default, sleep is implemented using TTC3. Although user is
*               given an option to select other instances of TTC. When the user
*               selects other instances of TTC, sleep is implemented by that
*		specific TTC instance. If the user didn't select any other instance
*	        of TTC specifically and when TTC3 is absent, sleep is implemented
*      	        using assembly instructions which is tested with instruction and
*		data caches enabled and it gives proper delay. It may give more
*		delay than exepcted when caches are disabled. If interrupt comes
*		when sleep using assembly instruction is being executed, the delay
*		may be greater than what is expected since once the interrupt is
*		served count resumes from where it was interrupted unlike the case
*		of TTC3 where counter keeps running while interrupt is being served.
