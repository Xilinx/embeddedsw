 * This is the default implementation of the "clock" function of the

 * implementation.
 *
 * The "clock" function should return the processor time used by the
 * program from some implementation-defined start time.  The value
 * should be such that if divided by the macro CLOCKS_PER_SEC the
 * result should yield the time in seconds.
 *
 * The value "(clock_t)-1" means that the processor time is not
