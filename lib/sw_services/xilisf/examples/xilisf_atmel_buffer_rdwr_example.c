/**
* @file xilisf_atmel_buffer_rdwr_example.c
*
*
* This file contains a design example using the Xilinx In-system and Serial
* Flash Library (XilIsf). This example shows the Buffer Write, Buffer to Page
* Program with Built-in Erase, Page to Buffer Transfer and Buffer Read features.
*
* This example
* - Writes to a SRAM page buffer using Buffer Write feature
* - Erase a Page and data is transferred to this page from the SRAM page buffer
*   using the Buffer to Page Program with Built-in Erase feature.
* - Transfers the data to a SRAM Page using Page to Buffer Transfer feature.
* - Reads back the Buffer that is written using the Buffer Read feature and
*   compares the data.
*
* The example works for AT45DB011D/AT45DB021D/AT45DB041D/AT45DB081D Serial Flash
* devices. The bytes per page (ISF_PAGE_SIZE) in these devices is 264 for
* Default addressing mode and 256 in Power-of-2 addressing mode.
*
* For AT45DB161D/AT45DB321D the Bytes Per Page (ISF_PAGE_SIZE) is 528 for
* Default addressing mode and 512 in Power-Of-2 addressing mode.
*
* For AT45DB642D the Bytes Per Page (ISF_PAGE_SIZE) is 1056 for Default
* addressing mode and 1024 in Power-Of-2 addressing mode.
*
* The ISF_PAGE_SIZE should be defined by the user according to the Device used.
*
* For further details of each device refer to the Spartan-3AN Serial Flash User
* Guide and data sheets of Atmel AT45XXXD .
*
* This example has been tested with the In-system Flash Memory available on the
* Spartan-3AN on a Xilinx Spartan-3AN Starter Kit board.
*
* @note
*
* None.
