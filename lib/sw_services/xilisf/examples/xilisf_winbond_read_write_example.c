*
* This file contains a design example using the In-system and Serial Flash
* Library (XilIsf) for Reading/Writing to a Winbond W25QXX/W25XX Serial Flash
* Device. This example shows the Erase, Read and Write features.
*
* This example
* - Erases a Sector
* - Writes to a Page within the Erased Sector
* - Reads back the Page that is written and compares the data
*
* This example  has been tested with a Winbond Serial Flash Memory (W25Q64) on
* a Xilinx SP605 board. For further details about the Flash device refer the
* Winbond Serial Flash Memory (W25Q64) data sheet.
