* This file contains a design example using the Xilinx In-system and Serial
* Flash Library (XilIsf). This example shows the One-Time Programmable (OTP)
* Read/Write features.
*
* This example
* - Writes a Byte to OTP region
* - Reads back the Byte written to the OTP region and compares the data
*
* This example has been tested with Intel (Numonyx) Serial Flash Memory (S33)
* on a S3A-DSP starter kit. For further details about the S33 Flash device refer
* to the Intel (Numonyx) Serial Flash Memory (S33) Data sheets.
