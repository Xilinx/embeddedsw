* This file contains a design example using the Xilinx In-system and Serial
* Flash Library (XilIsf). This example shows the Sector Protection Register
* Read, Sector Protection Register Write, Sector Erase, Read and Write features.
*
* This example
* - Disables the Sector Protection for all the Sectors
* - Erases a Sector
* - Writes to a Page within the Erased Sector
* - Reads back the Page that is written and compares the data.
*
* This example  has been tested with Intel (Numonyx) Serial Flash Memory (S33)
* on a S3A-DSP starter kit. For further details about the S33 Flash device refer
* to the Intel (Numonyx) Serial Flash Memory (S33) Data sheets.
