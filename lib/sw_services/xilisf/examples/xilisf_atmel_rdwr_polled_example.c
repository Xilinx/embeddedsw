/**
* @file xilisf_atmel_rdwr_polled_example.c
*
* This file contains a design example using the In-system and Serial Flash
* Library (XilIsf) with the Spi driver in polled mode of operation. This example
* shows the Erase, Read and Write features.
*
* This example
* - Erases a Page
* - Writes to the erased Page
* - Reads back the Page that is written and compares the data
*
* The example works for AT45DB011D/AT45DB021D/AT45DB041D/AT45DB081D Serial Flash
* devices. The bytes per page (ISF_PAGE_SIZE) in these devices is
* 264 for Default addressing mode and 256 in Power-of-2 addressing mode.
*
* For AT45DB161D/AT45DB321D devices the Bytes Per Page (ISF_PAGE_SIZE) is
* 528 for Default addressing mode and 512 in Power-Of-2 addressing mode.
*
* For AT45DB642D device the Bytes Per Page (ISF_PAGE_SIZE) is 1056 for Default
* addressing mode and 1024 in Power-Of-2 addressing mode.
*
* The ISF_PAGE_SIZE should be defined by the user according to the Device used.
*
* For further details of each device refer to the Spartan-3AN Serial Flash User
* Guide and data sheets of Atmel AT45XXXD .
*
* This example has been tested with the In-System Flash Memory available on the
* Spartan-3AN on a Xilinx Spartan-3AN Starter Kit board.
*
* @note
*
* None.
