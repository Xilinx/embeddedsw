* This is the header file which contains versal PLM configuration for users.
* All key configuration options are now made available through Vitis GUI and
* xsct command line. Hence, the corresponding defines now appear in
* xparameters.h file. However, references for those configurations are retained
* here in comments, for users who prefer configuring by updating sources.
* Please refer xparameters.h file (under comment "PLM/XilPLMI configuration")
* for the Vitis/tool generated definitions, while building, before attempting
* to edit definitions in this file

 *       Hence PLM_PRINT_VAL should always be 1
 *  Further PLM by default doesn't have any debug prints enabled. If user
 *  want to enable the debug prints, they can define the following
 *  options
 *  PLM supports three types of debug levels.
 *     - PLM_DEBUG Defining this will print basic information and
 *       error prints if any
 *     - PLM_DEBUG_INFO Defining this will have prints enabled with format
 *       specifiers in addition to the basic information
 *     - PLM_DEBUG_DETAILED Defining this will print information with
 *       all data exchanged.
 * Please note that below are defined in xparameters.h based on the
 * xilplmi library configuration, hence commented out here.
 * PLM_DEBUG is defined by default.
