 * @name PLM Debug options
 *
 *  PLM supports an unconditional print
 *     - PLM_PRINT Used to print PLM header and any mandatory prints
 *       Hence PLM_PRINT_VAL should always be 1
 *  Further PLM by default doesn't have any debug prints enabled. If user
 *  want to enable the debug prints, they can define the following
 *  options
 *  PLM supports three types of debug levels.
 *     - PLM_DEBUG Defining this will print basic information and
 *       error prints if any
 *     - PLM_DEBUG_INFO Defining this will have prints enabled with format
 *       specifiers in addition to the basic information
 *     - PLM_DEBUG_DETAILED Defining this will print information with
 *       all data exchanged.
