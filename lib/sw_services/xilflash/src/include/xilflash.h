*
* This module implements the functionality for flash memory devices that
* conform to the "Common Flash Interface" (CFI) standard. CFI allows a single
* flash library to be used for an entire family of parts.
*
* This is not a library for a specific device, but for a set of command
* read/write/erase algorithms. CFI allows us to determine which algorithm to
* utilize at runtime.
*
* <b>Library Initialization</b>
*
* The function call XFlash_Initialize() should be called by the application
* before any other function in the library. The initialization function checks
* for the device family and initializes the XFlash instance with the family
* specific data. The VT table (Contains the function pointers to family specific
* API's) is setup and family specific initialization routine is called.
*
* <b>Device Geometry</b>
*
* The Device geometry varies for different flash device families. The following
* list describes geometry of different flash device families:
*
* 	<b> Intel Flash Device Geometry </b>
*
* 	Flash memory space is segmented into areas called blocks. The size of
* 	each block is based on a power of 2. A region is defined as a contiguous
*	set of blocks of the same size. Some parts have several regions while
*	others have one. The arrangement of blocks and regions is refered to by
*	this module as the part's geometry. Some Intel flash supports multiple
*	banks on the same device. This library supports single and multiple bank
*	flash devices.
*
* 	<b> AMD Flash Device Geometry </b>
*
* 	Flash memory space is segmented into areas called banks and further in
*	to regions and blocks. The size of each block is based on a power of 2.
*	A region is defined as a contiguous set of blocks of the same size. Some
*	parts have several regions while others have one. A bank is defined as a
*	contiguous set of blocks. The bank may contain blocks of different size.
*	The arrangement of blocks, regions and banks is referred to by this
*	module as the part's geometry.
*
* 	The cells within the part can be programmed from a logic 1 to a logic 0
*	and not the other way around. To change a cell back to a logic 1, the
*	entire block containing that cell must be erased. When a block is erased
*	all bytes contain the value 0xFF. The number of times a block can be
*	erased is finite. Eventually the block will wear out and will no longer
*	be capable of erasure. As of this writing, the typical flash block can
*	be erased 100,000 or more times.
*
* <b>Write Operation</b>
*
* The write call can be used to write a minimum of zero bytes and a maximum
* entire flash. If the Offset Address specified to write is out of flash or if
* the number of bytes specified from the Offset address exceed flash boundaries
* an error is reported back to the user. The write is blocking in nature in that
* the control is returned back to user only after the write operation is
* completed successfully or an error is reported.
*
* <b>Read Operation</b>
*
* The read call can be used to read a minimum of zero bytes and maximum of
* entire flash. If the Offset Address specified to write is out of flash
* boundary an error is reported back to the user. The read function reads memory
* locations beyond Flash boundary. Care should be taken by the user to make sure
* that the Number of Bytes + Offset address is within the Flash address
* boundaries. The write is blocking in nature in that the control is returned
* back to user only after the read operation is completed successfully or an
* error is reported.
*
* <b>Erase Operation</b>
*
* The erase operations are provided to erase a Block in the Flash memory. The
* erase call is blocking in nature in that the control is returned back to user
* only after the erase operation is completed successfully or an error is
* reported.
*
* <b>Sector Protection</b>
*
* The Flash Device is divided into Blocks. Each Block can be protected
* individually from unwarranted writing/erasing. The Block locking can be
* achieved using XFlash_Lock() lock. All the memory locations from the Offset
* address specified will be locked. The block can be unlocked using
* XFlash_UnLock() call. All the Blocks which are previously locked will be
* unlocked. The Lock and Unlock calls are blocking in nature in that the control
* is returned back to user only after the operation is completed successfully or
* an error is reported.
* The AMD flash device requires high voltage on Reset pin to perform lock and
* unlock operation. User must provide this high voltage (As defined in
* datasheet) to reset pin before calling lock and unlock API for AMD flash
* devices. Lock and Unlock features are not tested for AMD flash device.
*
* <b>Device Control</b>
*
* Functionalities specific to a Flash Device Family are implemented as Device
* Control.
*
* The following are the Intel specific device control:
*	- Retrieve the last error data.
*	- Get Device geometry.
*	- Get Device properties.
* 	- Set RYBY pin mode.
*	- Set the Configuration register (Platform Flash only).

* The following are the AMD specific device control:
*	- Get Device geometry.
*	- Get Device properties.
*	- Erase Resume.
* 	- Erase Suspend.
* 	- Enter Extended Mode.
* 	- Exit Extended Mode.
*	- Get Protection Status of Block Group.
*	- Erase Chip.
*
* @note
*
* <b>This library needs to know the type of EMC core (AXI or XPS) used to
* access the cfi flash, to map the correct APIs. This library should be used
* with the emc driver, v3_01_a and above, so that this information can be
* automatically obtained from the emc driver.</b>
*
* This library is intended to be RTOS and processor independent. It works with
* physical addresses only. Any needs for dynamic memory management, threads,
* mutual exclusion, virtual memory, cache control, or HW write protection
* management must be satisfied by the layer above this library.
* <br><br>
* All writes to flash occur in units of bus-width bytes. If more than one part
* exists on the data bus, then the parts are written in parallel. Reads from
* flash are performed in any width up to the width of the data bus. It is
* assumed that the flash bus controller or local bus supports these types of
* accesses.
