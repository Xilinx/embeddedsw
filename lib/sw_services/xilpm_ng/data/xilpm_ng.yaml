# TODO: Need to add remaining driver list which are the dependencies for this
#       component.
#       Reasons:
#               - For other drivers have no effect of "depends" list while
#               getting added as dependencies.
#               - Implementation of architecture dependant driver dependency
#               is pending.
#       List of remaining drivers:
#               1) cframe
#               2) cfupmc
#               3) iicps
#               4) usbpsu
#               5) sdps
#               6) qspipsu
#               7) rtcpsu
#               8) ttcps
#               9) scugic
