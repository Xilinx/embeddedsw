*	into the Versal eFuse array when write API used. This value should
*	be given in string format. It should be 8 characters long, valid

*	into the Versal eFUSE array when write API used. This value should
*	be given in string format. It should be 8 characters long, valid
*	characters are 0-9,a-f,A-F. Any other character is considered as invalid
*	string and will not burn the Revocation Id 2 Fuse.
*	Note that,for writing the Revocation Id 2 Fuse,
*	XNVM_EFUSE_WRITE_REVOCATION_ID_2 should be set to TRUE.
*
*	#define XNVM_EFUSE_CHECK_AES_KEY_CRC			FALSE
*	Default value is FALSE
*	TRUE will validate AES key stored in eFuse by calculating its CRC
*	and comparing with CRC provided in XNVM_EFUSE_EXPECTED_AES_KEY_CRC.
*	CRC verification is done after programming the key to verify the key
*	is programmed properly or not, if not library error outs the same.
*	NOTE:
*	Please make sure if intention is to check only CRC of the provided key
*	and not programming AES key then do not modify XNVM_EFUSE_WRITE_AES_KEY
*	(TRUE will Program key).
*	This check is only applicable for server mode of eFuse example
*
*	#define XNVM_EFUSE_EXPECTED_AES_KEY_CRC		XNVM_EFUSE_CRC_AES_ZEROS
*	This is expected crc of the programmed Aes key given in hexa decimal.
*	Default is XNVM_EFUSE_CRC_AES_ZEROS Crc of the zero key
*
*	NOTE: The PPK hash should be the unmodified hash generated by bootgen.
*	Single bit programming is allowed for User eFuses (1 through 63),
*	however if the user specifies a value that tries to set a bit that was
*	previously programmed to 1 back to 0, program throws an error.
*	Even if the bits are already programmed user must pass these already
*	programmed bits along with the new bits that need to be programmed.
