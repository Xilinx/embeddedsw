<p>NOTE: The PPK hash should be the unmodified hash generated by bootgen. Single bit programming is allowed for User eFuses (1 through 63), however if the user specifies a value that tries to set a bit that was previously programmed to 1 back to 0, program throws an error. Even if the bits are already programmed user must pass these already programmed bits along with the new bits that need to be programmed.</p>
