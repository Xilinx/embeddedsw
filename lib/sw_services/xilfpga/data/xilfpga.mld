# Ver   Who  Date     Changes
# ----- ---- -------- -----------------------------------------------
# 1.0   Nava  08/06/16 First release
# 1.1   Nava  16/11/16 Added PL power-up sequence.
# 2.0   Nava  10/1/17  Added Encrypted bitstream loading support.
# 2.0   Nava  16/02/17 Added Authenticated bitstream loading support.
# 2.1   Nava  06/05/17 Correct the check logic issues in
# 		       XFpga_PL_BitStream_Load()
# 		       to avoid the unwanted blocking conditions.
# 3.0   Nava  12/05/17 Added PL configuration registers readback support.
# 4.0   Nava  08/02/18 Added Authenticated and Encypted Bitstream loading support.
#       srm   02/26/18 Updated to pick up latest freertos port 10.0
# 4.1  Nava   27/03/18 For Secure Bitstream loading to avoid the Security violations
#                      Need to Re-validate the User Crypto flags with the Image
#                      Crypto operation by using the internal memory.To Fix this
#                      added a new API XFpga_ReValidateCryptoFlags().
# 4.1 Nava   16/04/18  Added partial bitstream loading support.
# 4.2 Nava   30/05/18  Refactor the xilfpga library to support
#                      different PL programming Interfaces.
# 4.2 Nava   15/09/18  Fixed global function call-backs issue.
# 5.0 Nava   11/05/18  Added full bitstream loading support for versal Platform.
# 5.0 Nava   29/03/19  Removed vesal platform related changes.As per the new
#		       design, the Bitstream loading for versal platform is
#		       done by PLM based on the CDO's data exists in the PDI
#		       images. So there is no need of xilfpga API's for versal
#		       platform to configure the PL.
