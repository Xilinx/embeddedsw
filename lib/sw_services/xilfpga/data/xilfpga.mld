#
# Ver   Who  Date     Changes
# ----- ---- -------- -----------------------------------------------
# 1.0   Nava  06/08/16 First release
# 1.1   Nava  11/16/16 Added PL power-up sequence.
# 2.0   Nava  01/10/17  Added Encrypted bitstream loading support.
# 2.0   Nava  02/16/17 Added Authenticated bitstream loading support.
# 2.1   Nava  05/06/17 Correct the check logic issues in
# 		       XFpga_PL_BitStream_Load()
# 		       to avoid the unwanted blocking conditions.
# 3.0   Nava  05/12/17 Added PL configuration registers readback support.
# 4.0   Nava  02/08/18 Added Authenticated and Encypted Bitstream loading support.
#       srm   02/26/18 Updated to pick up latest freertos port 10.0
# 4.1  Nava   03/27/18 For Secure Bitstream loading to avoid the Security violations
#                      Need to Re-validate the User Crypto flags with the Image
#                      Crypto operation by using the internal memory.To Fix this
#                      added a new API XFpga_ReValidateCryptoFlags().
# 4.1 Nava   04/16/18  Added partial bitstream loading support.
# 4.2 Nava   05/30/18  Refactor the xilfpga library to support
#                      different PL programming Interfaces.
# 4.2 Nava   09/15/18  Fixed global function call-backs issue.
# 5.0 Nava   05/11/18  Added full bitstream loading support for versal Platform.
# 5.0 Nava   03/29/19  Removed Versal platform related changes.As per the new
#		       design, the Bitstream loading for versal platform is
#		       done by PLM based on the CDO's data exists in the PDI
#		       images. So there is no need of xilfpga API's for versal
#		       platform to configure the PL.
# 5.1 Nava   06/27/19  Updated documentation for readback API's.
# 5.2 Nava   11/10/19  Clear the key info from DDR or Physical memory Once it
#                      preserves into the internal memory.
# 5.2 Nava   12/05/19  Added Versal platform support.
# 5.2 Nava   01/02/20  Added secure_readback param to support secure PL
#                      configuration data readback.
# 5.2 Nava   02/14/20  Added Bitstream loading support by using IPI services
#                      for ZynqMP platform.
# 5.3 Nava   06/16/20  Modified the date format from dd/mm to mm/dd.
# 5.3 Nava   09/16/20  Added user configurable Enable/Disable Options for
#                      readback operations
# 6.0 Nava   12/14/20  In XFpga_PL_BitStream_Load() API the argument
#                      AddrPtr_Size is being used for multiple purposes.
#                      Use of the same variable for multiple purposes can
#                      make it more difficult for a person to read (or)
#                      understand the code and also it leads to a safety
#                      violation. fixes this  issue by adding a separate
#                      function arguments to read KeyAddr and
#                      Size(Bitstream size).
# 6.1 Nava   09/13/21  Fixed compilation warnings.
# 6.2 Nava   12/13/21  Replaced library specific utility functions and standard
#                      lib functions with Xilinx maintained functions.
# 6.2 Nava   01/10/22  Adds XFpga_GetVersion() and XFpga_GetFeatureList() API's
#                      to provide the access to the xilfpga library to get the
#                      xilfpga version and supported feature list info.
# 6.2 Nava   01/19/22  Added build time flag to skip eFUSE checks
# 6.3 Nava   06/22/22  Skip eFUSE checks to allow xilfpga to load non-secure
#                      bitstream in secure boot platform.
# 6.4 Nava   01/23/23  Added psx processors in supported peripherals
# 6.5 Nava   05/04/23  Added support for system device-tree flow.
# 6.6  adk   10/19/23  Added changes for NON_YOCTO variable specific to SDT flow
# 6.7  oh    07/24/24  Added Versal_2VE_2VM specific processor in dependency list
