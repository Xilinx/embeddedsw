 * ----- ------  -------- ------------------------------------------------------
 * 1.0   Nava    08/06/16  First release
 * 4.0   Nava	21/02/18  Updated the example relevant to src code changes.
 * 4.2   Nava    30/05/18  Refactor the xilfpga library to support
 *                         different PL programming Interfaces.
 * 4.2	 adk	 23/08/18  Added bitstream size define.
 * 5.0   Nava	 06/02/19  Updated the example to sync with 5.0 version API's
 * 5.0	 Nava 	 16/03/19  Typical bitstram size of zcu102 board is 26MB.So
 *			   updated the bitstream size macro value for the same.

/**************************** Type Definitions *******************************/
/* Xilfpga library supports vivado generated Bitstream(*.bit, *.bin) and bootgen
 * generated Bitstream(*.bin), Passing below definition is mandatory for vivado
 * generated Bitstream, For bootgen generated Bitstreams Xilfpga will take
 * Bitstream size from Bitstream Header.
 *
 * Below definition is for typical bitstream size of zcu102 board
 * User should replace the below definition value with the actual bitstream size.
 *
 * @note: This example supports only Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC platform.
