 * Partial reconfiguration(PR) is the ability for a portion of an FPGA to be
 * reprogrammed while the remainder of the system stays unchanged. Dynamic PR
 * allows device reconfiguration during runtime while rest of the Device is
 * still functioning.
 *
 * This file contains the example using xilfpga library to transfer the user
 * provided Partial Reconfiguration Bitstream into ZynqMP PL region.
 * Before loading this example please make sure static Bitstream associated with
 * the PR design has been loaded into the PL.

 * 4.2   adk     03/08/18  Initial Release.
 * 4.2	 adk	 23/08/18  Added bitstream size define.
 * 5.0   Nava	 06/02/19  Updated the example to sync with 5.0 version API's

 * Below definition is for typical Partial Bitstream size of zcu102 board
