*	#define XSK_BBRAM_DPA_PROTECT_ENABLE	FALSE
*	TRUE will enable the DPA protection for BBRAM key, to enable
*	DPA protection XSK_BBRAM_PGM_OBFUSCATED_KEY should be FALSE,
*	as DPA protection is not supported for Obfuscated key due to silicon
*	bug, XSK_BBRAM_DPA_COUNT should be in the range of 1-255 and
*	XSK_BBRAM_DPA_MODE can be XSK_BBRAM_INVALID_CONFIGURATIONS or
*	XSK_BBRAM_ALL_CONFIGURATIONS.
*	FALSE will not enable DPA protection, XSK_BBRAM_DPA_COUNT and

*	XSK_BBRAM_INVALID_CONFIGURATIONS respectively
*
*	#define XSK_BBRAM_DPA_COUNT	0
*	Default value will be zero,
*	when XSK_BBRAM_DPA_PROTECT_ENABLE is TRUE this should be in range
*	of 1-255 (should be greater that zero).
*
*	#define XSK_BBRAM_DPA_MODE	XSK_BBRAM_INVALID_CONFIGURATIONS
*	Default value is XSK_BBRAM_INVALID_CONFIGURATIONS
*	When XSK_BBRAM_DPA_PROTECT_ENABLE is TRUE it can be
*	XSK_BBRAM_INVALID_CONFIGURATIONS or XSK_BBRAM_ALL_CONFIGURATIONS
*	If XSK_BBRAM_DPA_PROTECT_ENABLE is FALSE, it should be
*	XSK_BBRAM_INVALID_CONFIGURATIONS.
*
*	#define XSK_BBRAM_AXI_GPIO_DEVICE_ID  XPAR_AXI_GPIO_0_DEVICE_ID
*	Default value is XPAR_AXI_GPIO_0_DEVICE_ID
*	This macro is for providing exact GPIO device ID, based on the
*	design configuration this macro should be modified to provide
*	GPIO device ID which is used for connecting MASTER JTAG pins.
*
*	In Ultrascale GPIO pins are used for connecting MASTER_JTAG pins to
*	access BBRAM.
*	Following are the GPIO pins and user can change these pins
*	#define XSK_BBRAM_AXI_GPIO_JTAG_TDO	(0)
*	#define XSK_BBRAM_AXI_GPIO_JTAG_TDI	(0)
*	#define XSK_BBRAM_AXI_GPIO_JTAG_TMS	(1)
*	#define XSK_BBRAM_AXI_GPIO_JTAG_TCK	(2)
*
*	#define XSK_BBRAM_GPIO_INPUT_CH		(2)
*	This macro is for providing channel number of ALL INPUTS connected(TDO)
*	#define XSK_BBRAM_GPIO_OUTPUT_CH	(1)
*	This macro is for providing channel number of ALL OUTPUTS connected
*	(TDI, TCK, TMS)
*
*	NOTE: All inputs and outputs of GPIO can be configured in single
*	channel also
*	i.e XSK_BBRAM_GPIO_INPUT_CH = XSK_BBRAM_GPIO_OUTPUT_CH = 1 or 2.
*	Among (TDI, TCK, TMS) Outputs of GPIO cannot be connected to different
*	GPIO channels all the 3 signals should be in same channel.
*	TDO can be a other channel of (TDI, TCK, TMS) or the same.
*	DPA protection can be enabled only when programming non-obfuscated key.
