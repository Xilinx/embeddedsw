*                        XSK_EFUSEPS_PPK1_REVOKE->XSK_EFUSEPS_PPK1_INVLD
*                        Added support for programming LBIST, LPD and FPD
*                        SC enable bits by providing corresponding macros
*                        Removed 3 macros for PROG GATE disable, now it can
*                        programmed by setting only one macro.
* 6.7	psl     03/13/19 Added XSK_EFUSEPS_CHECK_AES_KEY_CRC, to check for
* 						 AES key CRC if TRUE.
* 	psl     03/28/19 Updated Description for XSK_EFUSEPS_CHECK_AES_KEY_CRC
