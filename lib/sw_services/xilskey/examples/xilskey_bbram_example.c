* @file
* 			xilskey_bbram_example.c
* @note
*	Example illustrates the method of programming the AES key to BBRAM.
*	The user key should be mentioned in xilskey_input.h.
*	BBRAM is a battery backed RAM and there is no restriction on the
*	number of times key can programmed.
*	This algorithm only wokrs when program and verify key are done
*	together and in that order.
.
* Procedure:
* 1. Create a hardware project using the appropriate design.
* 2. Create a BSP.
* 3. Create fsbl
* 4. Create an application project using bbram example and xilskey_input.h
* 5. The 256 bit key to be programmed has to be mentioned
* 6. A hardware setup which dedicates four MIO pins for JTAG signals
*    should be used and the MIO pins should be mentioned in xilskey_input.h
*    There should be a method to download this example and have the
*    MIO pins connected to JTAG before running this application.
* 7. Run the application which will program and verify the BBRAM key
* 8. After programming and veifying the key, power off.
* 9. Place a BBRAM key encrypted boot image in one of the boot devices,
*    set the appropriate boot pins and power on.
* 10. The bbram example will be run from DDR with the default linker.
* 11. To run from OCM, modify the linker to map all sections to
*     ps7_ram_0_S_AXI_BASEADDR instead of ps7_ddr_0_S_AXI_BASEADDR.
*
*
* MODIFICATION HISTORY:
*
* Ver   Who  	Date     Changes
* ----- ---- 	-------- --------------------------------------------------------
* 1.01a hk      09/18/13 First release
* 6.1   vns     10/25/16 Removed ForcePowerCycle and JtagDisable from Zynq
*                        BBRAM configuration as they are not actually
*                        programming any control bit.
* 6.7   psl     03/20/19 Added BBRAM jtag server init function.
*       psl     03/15/19 Moved XilSKey_Bbram_JTAGServerInit function from
*                        example to library.
