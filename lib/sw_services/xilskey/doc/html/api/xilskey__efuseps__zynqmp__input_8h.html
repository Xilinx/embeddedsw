<p>#define XSK_EFUSEPS_CHECK_AES_KEY_CRC FALSE Default value is FALSE TRUE will check the CRC provided in XSK_EFUSEPS_AES_KEY. CRC verification is done after programming AES key to verify the key is programmed properly or not, if not library error outs the same. So While programming AES key it is not necessary to verify the AES key again. NOTE: Please make sure if intention is to check only CRC of the provided key and not programming AES key then do not modify XSK_EFUSEPS_WRITE_AES_KEY (TRUE will Program key).</p>
<p>NOTE: The PPK hash should be the unmodified hash generated by bootgen. Single bit programming is allowed for User FUSEs (0 through 7), however if the user specifies a value that tries to set a bit that was previously programmed to 1 back to 0, throws an error. Even if the bits are already programmed user must pass these already programmed bits along with the new bits that need to be programmed.</p>

 4.0   vns     10/01/15 First release
 6.0   vns     07/18/16 Removed JTAG user code programming and reading
                        feature. Modified User FUSE programming, such that
                        library accepts separate requests for programming
                        and reading USER FUSES(0 to 7). Provided single bit
                        programming feature for USER FUSEs.

                        SC enable bits by providing corresponding macros
                        Removed 3 macros for PROG GATE disable, now it can
                        programmed by setting only one macro.
 6.7    psl     03/13/19 Added XSK_EFUSEPS_CHECK_AES_KEY_CRC, to check for
                                                 AES key CRC if TRUE.
        psl     03/28/19 Updated Description for XSK_EFUSEPS_CHECK_AES_KEY_CRC
 6.8   psl     06/07/19 Added doxygen tags.
       vns     08/30/19 Corrected string for PPK1 hash to 384 bit
 6.9   har     06/17/20 Removed macros XSK_EFUSEPS_PPK0_IS_SHA3 and
                        XSK_EFUSEPS_PPK1_IS_SHA3
