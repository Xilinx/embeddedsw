/**
 * PmMaster - contains PM master related informations
 * @procs       Pointer to the array of processors within the master
 * @wakeProc    Processor to wake-up (pointer to the processor that has been
 *              suspended the last)
 * @reqs        Pointer to the master's list of requirements for slaves'
 *              capabilities. For every slave that the master can use there has
 *              to be a dedicated requirements structure
 * @nextMaster  Pointer to the next used master in the system
 * @gic         If the master has its own GIC which is controlled by the PMU,
 *              this is a pointer to it.
 * @evalState   Function to be called when a state specified by the master
 *              needs to be evaluated (implicit scheduling of requirements)
 * @remapAddr   Remap address (used when master's and PMU's memory map differ)
 * @memories    Pointer to the array of memories used by the master
 * @ipiMask     Mask dedicated to the master in IPI registers
 * @nid         Placeholder nodeId - used to encode request suspend for group of
 *              processors sharing the same communication channel. When PM
 *              receives this nid as request suspend argument, it initiates
 *              init suspend to the master. At the PU, in init_suspend_cb
 *              implementation, the request is mappend to actual suspend of all
 *              processors in the PU. In RPU case, this data could be
 *              initialized from PCW, based on RPU configuration.
 * @procsCnt    Number of processors within the master
 * @wakePerms   ORed ipi masks of masters which can wake-up this master
 * @suspendPerms ORed ipi masks of masters which can request this master to
 *              suspend
 * @suspendRequest Captures info about the ongoing suspend request (this master
 *              is the target which suppose to suspend). At any moment only
 *              one suspend request can be active for one target/master
 * @suspendTimeout Timeout which specifies how much time the master has to
 *              complete suspend, otherwise it is considered to be unresponsive
 * @state       State of the master which is a combination of the states of its
 *              processors and also depends on the order in which processors
 *              enter their states.
