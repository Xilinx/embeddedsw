#
# GNU General Public License Exception
#
# Any FreeRTOS source code, whether modified or in its original release form,
# or whether in whole or in part, can only be distributed by you under the
# terms of the GNU General Public License plus this exception. An independent
# module is a module which is not derived from or based on FreeRTOS.
#
# EXCEPTION TEXT:
#
# Clause 1
#
# Linking FreeRTOS statically or dynamically with other modules is making a
# combined work based on FreeRTOS. Thus, the terms and conditions of the
# GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.
#
# As a special exception, the copyright holder of FreeRTOS gives you permission
# to link FreeRTOS with independent modules that communicate with FreeRTOS
# solely through the FreeRTOS API interface, regardless of the license terms
# of these independent modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting
# combined work under terms of your choice, provided that 
#
# Every copy of the combined work is accompanied by a written statement that
# details to the recipient the version of FreeRTOS used and an offer by
# yourself to provide the FreeRTOS source code (including any modifications
# you may have  made) should the recipient request it.
# The combined work is not itself an RTOS, scheduler, kernel or related product.
# The independent modules add significant and primary functionality to FreeRTOS
# and do not merely extend the existing functionality already present 
# in FreeRTOS.
#
# Clause 2
#
# FreeRTOS may not be used for any competitive or comparative purpose,
# including the publication of any form of run time or compile time metric,
# without the express permission of Real Time Engineers Ltd. (this is the norm
# within the industry and is intended to ensure information accuracy).
