Until a master calls PmInitFinalize, PFW will keep running/On all slaves which the master can use (this is defined with permissions provided in the configuration object). If a master doesn't have PM support, it will never call PmInitFinalize, so PFW will always ensure that all slaves that the master can use remain running.
- New 'uninitialized' state is used to capture that a master has not called PmInitFinalize. All masters are initially 'uninitialized'.

Made changes in xscugic.c. Created a new static function DoDistributorInit to simplify the flow and avoid code duplication.
Changes are made for USE_AMP use case for R5. In a scenario (in R5 split mode) when one R5 is operating with A53 in open amp config
and other R5 is running baremetal application, the existing code had the potential to stop AMP to work (if for some reason
the R5 running the baremetal app tasked to initialize the Distributor hangs or crashes before initializing the Distributor).
Changes are made so that the R5 under AMP first checks if the distributor is enabled or not and if not, it does the standard Distributor initialization.
This fixes the CR#952962.

moved to src/arm directory(i.e. src/cortexa53,src/cortexa9 and src/cortexr5 moved to src/arm/cortexa53,src/arm/cortexa9
and src/arm/cortexr5 respectively).Files xil_printf.c,xil_printf.h,print.c,xil_io.c and xil_io.h are consolidated across all
BSPs into common file each and consolidated files are kept at src/common directory.Files putnum.c,vectors.c,vectors.h,
xil_exception.c and xil_exception.h are consolidated across all ARM BSPs into common file each and consolidated
files are kept at src/arm/common directory.GCC files related to file operations are consolidated and kept at src/arm/common/gcc
directory.
All io interfacing functions (i.e. All variants of xil_out, xil_in ) are made as static inline and implementation
is kept in consolidated common/xil_io.h,xil_io.h must be included as a header file to access io interfacing functions.
Added undefined exception handler for A53 32 bit and R5 processor.
Updated xtime_l.c in R5 BSP to remove implementation of XTime_SetTime API, since TTC counter value register is read only.

zynqmp_pmufw:

- The IPI Framework is now fully integrated with IPI Driver.
So PMUFW now works only with a HDF generated from 2016.3 release
and uses the IPI configuration as specified in HDF.

- FPD power-off suspend is now supported with DDR in self-refresh mode.
The sequences required for transitioning DDR into and out of Self-Refresh
are included in this release.

- Clocks dependencies are modelled and PLLs usage is accounted. This enables
suspending of unused PLLs.

- PMUFW syncs up with FSBL to initialize the clock/PLL related data structures.
IPI or a Register Poll is used as a sync mechanism depending on the order in
which FSBL and PMUFW are loaded. A corresponding change in FSBL is also in
this release, which means the sync mechanism is taken care seamlessly in the flow.

- Linker script has fixes to account for the exact size of PMU RAM available for
Firmware, which is 125.7 KB. By default PMUFW is built with -O0 optimization.
In case of insufficient memory due to addition of custom code, optimization
can be changed to -Os.

- PMUFW uses XilFPGA library and it is included by default in the build.
APIs to load bitstream into PL have been added.

- TCMs are initialized to prevent ECC errors during a power cycle and all
dependencies to make TCMs accessible are handled.

- FPD power up/down routines are made available as hooks which can be used to
override default handlers.

- Power operations (using PM module) on unavailable islands have been blocked and
return an error.

- Each module now resides in its own file with xpfw_mod_ prefix. All modules
should follow the same prefix to differentiate from core files and
segregate functionality.

zynqmp_fsbl:
- Avoided multiple IPI triggers during PMUFW load. FSBL now triggers IPI for just the first partition of PMUFW. FSBL wakes up PMU after loading all partitions.
- Added compile time check to ensure FSBL (A53_64) is built only with EL3 BSP.
- Added support for SHA3 checksum validation by FSBL for partitions that it loads.
- FSBL identifies device type and restricts handoff to unavailable CPU cores accordingly.
- To optimize usage of OCM, reduced stack usage of exception handlers (R5) and removed stacks for EL0/1/2.
- Changed the ECC Initialization code to use ADMA for DMA transfers. Earlier, GDMA was used, which cannot be accessed when FPD is powered down.
- FSBL now calls protection/security configuration functions defined by psu_init. This is used for XMPU/XPPU configuration, if any, as per design.
- Changed FSBL error code storage register to PMU_GLOBAL_PERS_GLOB_GEN_STORAGE4 (0xFFD80040).
- Added XFsbl_PmInit call to notify PMU firmware that initialization of all PM related registers is complete.
- Corrected print format for Performance measurement value (fractional part).
- Authentication Certificate for the partition will now be copied separately to an OCM buffer (not to memory area where partition is to be loaded).
- Changed the FSBL memory layout to have more space for ATF in OCM. FSBL now starts at 0xFFFC0000 and ends at 0xFFFEA000.
- Added support for TCM ECC Initialization in FSBL (always in R5 and conditionally in A53).
- Added a hook in FSBL to facilitate users to define different variants of psu_init() functions based on different configurations in Vivado.
- Remove inline specifier from function prototypes (as per new version of GCC).
- Corrected (feature include/exclude) logic to resolve DDRless build failure.
- Change done to calculate the actual read offset including bad blocks while reading from NAND. This read offset will be calculated against each read call from FSBL.
- Disabled the use_mkfs option in FSBL.

zynq_fsbl:
- Fabric Initialization sequence is modified to check the PL power before sequence starts and checking INIT_B reset status twice in case of failure.

3. HDCP 1.x driver now uses AXI timer 4.1, so updated to use AXI Timer config structure to determine timer clock frequency
4. HDCP 1.x driver has fixed the problem where the reset for the receiver causes the entire DDC peripheral to get reset. Based on this change the driver has been updated to use XV_HdmiTxSs_HdcpReset and XV_HdmiRxSs_HdcpReset functions directly.
5. Updated XV_HdmiTxSs_HdcpEnable and XV_HdmiRxSs_HdcpEnable functions to ensure that HDCP 1.4 and 2.2 are mutually exclusive. This fixes the problem where HDCP 1.4 and 2.2 state machines are running simultaneously.

zynqmp_fsbl:
Fix for decryption only secure test failure in R5, by disabling data cache.
Workaround provided in FSBL for SD card insert/remove detection.

When FSBL runs on R5, FSBL's vectors are overwritten with those of user applications. This is now avoided for non-secure boot.
Added support for Winbond 64M and ISSI 128M QSPI parts.
Fix the issue in FSBL when only WDT1 is present in design.
R5 BSP now disables debug logic and enables comparators. For R5 Lockstep, in JTAG bootmode, Turn-off comparators and enable debug logic so that further applications can be ran on JTAG.
Added the PL reset capability using EMIO[95-92] in FSBL after successful PL configuration.
Fix the logic to determine the bank crossing condition in case of a dual parallel qspi connection. Also corresponding change fix done to calculate the number of bytes to be programmed in a given bank.
A workaround is provided in FSBL to power-up PL before MIO configuration (for Silicon versions 1 and 2). Also, removal of isolation for PL is now deferred until its configuration is done.
Added support for PS-Only reset, i.e. only the PS component is reset without re-configuring the PL component.
Added support for Macronix QSPI flash parts.
Changed linker script. With this, FSBL now fails to build (linker error) if FSBL's loadable sections exceed the OCM region allotted to it. This avoids possible overlap of FSBL with other applications built for OCM.

Updated extra compiler flags for A53-64 (ARMA53_64), A53-32 (ARMA53_32).
Added support for PL bitstream loading in DDRless system.
To minimize the possibility of speculative access of DDR before it is initialized, in A53 FSBL's translation table (duplicated from BSP), DDR region is marked as "reserved". DDR region is again marked as "Memory" after DDR initialization.
Due to a bug in 1.0 Silicon, PS hangs after System Reset if RPLL is used. Hence, just for 1.0 Silicon, RPLL clock is bypassed before giving System Reset (this is workaround in FSBL).
When multiboot register value is non zero and when second SD instance is used, the bin filename was incorrectly determined in FSBL. This is fixed now.
Fix for failure in authenticating PL bitsream.
Restrict cores for which FSBL can be created (throw error if not running on A53-0, R5-0, R5-L).
Renamed stack names in A53 FSBL linker script.

zynq_fsbl:
PS UART code is now referred only when PS UART is present in design. This is since STDOUT_BASEADDRESS is defined even for coresight UART.
Added support for Macronix flash.
Removed the hard coded value of qspi read command and configured to pick from LQSPI_CFG register.
As xilrsa is not mandatory for zynq, remove xilrsa check while creating application in SDK.
