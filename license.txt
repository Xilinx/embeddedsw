out: - 'sent' is always called with len0 to the upper layer. This is because
keeping track of the ratio of application data and TLS overhead would be too
much. Mandatory security-related configuration: - ensure to add at least one
strong entropy source to your mbedtls port (implement
mbedtls_platform_entropy_poll or mbedtls_hardware_poll providing strong entropy)
- define ALTCP_MBEDTLS_ENTROPY_PTR and ALTCP_MBEDTLS_ENTROPY_LEN to something
providing GOOD custom entropy Missing things / @todo: - some unhandled/untested
things migh be caught by LWIP_ASSERTs...

things / @todo: - RX data is acknowledged after receiving (tcp_recved is called
when enqueueing the pbuf for mbedTLS receive, not when processed by mbedTLS or
the inner connection; altcp_recved() from inner connection does nothing) - TX
data is marked as 'sent' (i.e. acknowledged; sent callback is called) right
after enqueueing for transmission, not when actually ACKed be the remote host.

OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Original version by James
Carlson This implementation of EAP supports MD5-Challenge and SRP-SHA1
authentication styles. Note that support of MD5-Challenge is a requirement of
RFC 2284, and that it's essentially just a reimplementation of regular RFC 1994
CHAP using EAP messages. As an authenticator ("server"), there are multiple
phases for each style. In the first phase of each style, the unauthenticated
peer name is queried using the EAP Identity request type. If the "remotename"
option is used, then this phase is skipped, because the peer's name is presumed
to be known. For MD5-Challenge, there are two phases, and the second phase
consists of sending the challenge itself and handling the associated response.
For SRP-SHA1, there are four phases. The second sends 's', 'N', and 'g'. The
reply contains 'A'. The third sends 'B', and the reply contains 'M1'. The forth
sends the 'M2' value. As an authenticatee ("client"), there's just a single
phase responding to the queries generated by the peer. EAP is an authenticator-
driven protocol. Based on draft-ietf-pppext-eap-srp-03.txt.

This file is taken from https://github.com/B-Con/crypto-algorithms.
These are basic implementations of standard cryptography algorithms,
written by Brad Conte (brad@bradconte.com) from scratch and without
any cross-licensing. They exist to provide publically accessible,
restriction-free implementations of popular cryptographic algorithms,
like AES and SHA-1. These are primarily intended for educational and
pragmatic purposes (such as comparing a specification to actual
implementation code, or for building an internal application that
computes test vectors for a product). The algorithms have been tested
against standard test vectors.

This code is released into the public domain free of any restrictions.
The author requests acknowledgement if the code is used, but does not
require it. This code is provided free of any liability and without any
quality claims by the author.

Note that these are not cryptographically secure implementations. They
have no resistence to side-channel attacks and should not be used in
contexts that need cryptographically secure implementations.

These algorithms are not optimized for speed or space. They are primarily
designed to be easy to read, although some basic optimization techniques
have been employed
