http://www.FreeRTOS.org http://aws.amazon.com/freertos 1 tab 4 spaces! / This is
the list implementation used by the scheduler. While it is tailored heavily for
the schedulers needs, it is also available for use by application code. list_ts
can only store pointers to list_item_ts. Each ListItem_t contains a numeric
value (xItemValue). Most of the time the lists are sorted in descending item
value order. Lists are created already containing one list item. The value of
this item is the maximum possible that can be stored, it is therefore always at
the end of the list and acts as a marker. The list member pxHead always points
to this marker - even though it is at the tail of the list. This is because the
tail contains a wrap back pointer to the true head of the list. In addition to
it's value, each list item contains a pointer to the next item in the list
(pxNext), a pointer to the list it is in (pxContainer) and a pointer to back to
the object that contains it. These later two pointers are included for
efficiency of list manipulation. There is effectively a two way link between the
object containing the list item and the list item itself. \page ListIntroduction

http://www.FreeRTOS.org http://aws.amazon.com/freertos 1 tab 4 spaces! / Message
buffers build functionality on top of FreeRTOS stream buffers. Whereas stream
buffers are used to send a continuous stream of data from one task or interrupt
to another, message buffers are used to send variable length discrete messages
from one task or interrupt to another. Their implementation is light weight,
making them particularly suited for interrupt to task and core to core
communication scenarios. NOTE: Uniquely among FreeRTOS objects, the stream
buffer implementation (so also the message buffer implementation, as message
buffers are built on top of stream buffers) assumes there is only one task or
interrupt that will write to the buffer (the writer), and only one task or
interrupt that will read from the buffer (the reader). It is safe for the writer
and reader to be different tasks or interrupts, but, unlike other FreeRTOS
objects, it is not safe to have multiple different writers or multiple different
readers. If there are to be multiple different writers then the application
writer must place each call to a writing API function (such as
xMessageBufferSend()) inside a critical section and set the send block time to
0. Likewise, if there are to be multiple different readers then the application
writer must place each call to a reading API function (such as
xMessageBufferRead()) inside a critical section and set the receive timeout to
0. Message buffers hold variable length messages. To enable that, when a message
is written to the message buffer an additional sizeof( size_t ) bytes are also
written to store the message's length (that happens internally, with the API
function). sizeof( size_t ) is typically 4 bytes on a 32-bit architecture, so
writing a 10 byte message to a message buffer on a 32-bit architecture will
actually reduce the available space in the message buffer by 14 bytes (10 byte
are used by the message, and 4 bytes to hold the length of the message). /

http://www.FreeRTOS.org http://aws.amazon.com/freertos 1 tab 4 spaces! / A
sample implementation of pvPortMalloc() that allows the heap to be defined
across multiple non-contigous blocks and combines (coalescences) adjacent memory
blocks as they are freed. See heap_1.c, heap_2.c, heap_3.c and heap_4.c for
alternative implementations, and the memory management pages of
http://www.FreeRTOS.org for more information. Usage notes:
vPortDefineHeapRegions() must be called before pvPortMalloc(). pvPortMalloc()
will be called if any task objects (tasks, queues, event groups, etc.) are
created, therefore vPortDefineHeapRegions() must be called before any other
objects are defined. vPortDefineHeapRegions() takes a single parameter. The
parameter is an array of HeapRegion_t structures. HeapRegion_t is defined in
portable.h as typedef struct HeapRegion { uint8_t pucStartAddress; << Start
address of a block of memory that will be part of the heap. size_t xSizeInBytes;
<< Size of the block of memory. } HeapRegion_t; The array is terminated using a
NULL zero sized region definition, and the memory regions defined in the array
must appear in address order from low address to high address. So the following
is a valid example of how to use the function. HeapRegion_t xHeapRegions[] { { (
uint8_t ) 0x80000000UL, 0x10000 }, << Defines a block of 0x10000 bytes starting
at address 0x80000000 { ( uint8_t ) 0x90000000UL, 0xa0000 }, << Defines a block
of 0xa0000 bytes starting at address of 0x90000000 { NULL, 0 } << Terminates the
array. }; vPortDefineHeapRegions( xHeapRegions ); << Pass the array into
vPortDefineHeapRegions(). Note 0x80000000 is the lower address so appears in the
array first. /

(recommended 60 which is a minute) define DHCP_FINE_TIMER_MSECS (recommended 500
which equals TCP coarse timer) Then have your application call dhcp_coarse_tmr()
and dhcp_fine_tmr() on the defined intervals. dhcp_start(struct netif netif);
starts a DHCP client instance which configures the interface by obtaining an IP
address lease and maintaining it. Use dhcp_release(netif) to end the lease and
use dhcp_stop(netif) to remove the DHCP client. /

DNS.C The lwIP DNS resolver functions are used to lookup a host name and map it
to a numerical IP address. It maintains a list of resolved hostnames that can be
queried with the dns_lookup() function. New hostnames can be resolved using the
dns_query() function. The lwIP version of the resolver also adds a non-blocking
version of gethostbyname() that will work with a raw API application. This
function checks for an IP address string first and converts it if it is valid.
gethostbyname() then does a dns_lookup() to see if the name is already in the
table. If so, the IP is returned. If not, a query is issued and the function
returns with a ERR_INPROGRESS status. The app using the dns client must then go
into a waiting state. Once a hostname has been resolved (or found to be non-
existent), the resolver code calls a specified callback function (which must be
implemented by the module that uses the resolver). / RFC 1035 - Domain names -

@file Packet buffer management Packets are built from the pbuf data structure.
It supports dynamic memory allocation for packet contents or can reference
externally managed packet contents both in RAM and ROM. Quick allocation for
incoming packets is provided through pools with fixed sized pbufs. A packet may
span over multiple pbufs, chained as a singly linked list. This is called a
"pbuf chain". Multiple packets may be queued, also using this singly linked
list. This is called a "packet queue". So, a packet queue consists of one or
more pbuf chains, each of which consist of one or more pbufs. CURRENTLY, PACKET
QUEUES ARE NOT SUPPORTED!!! Use helper structs to queue multiple packets. The
differences between a pbuf chain and a packet queue are very precise but subtle.
The last pbuf of a packet has a ->tot_len field that equals the ->len field. It
can be found by traversing the list. If the last pbuf of a packet has a ->next
field other than NULL, more packets are on the queue. Therefore, looping through
a pbuf of a single packet, has an loop end condition (tot_len p->len), NOT (next
NULL). / Copyright (c) 2001-2004 Swedish Institute of Computer Science. All

It aims to conform with RFC 3927. Please coordinate changes and requests with
Dominik Spies <kontakt@dspies.de> / USAGE: define LWIP_AUTOIP 1 in your
lwipopts.h If you don't use tcpip.c (so, don't call, you don't call tcpip_init):
- First, call autoip_init(). - call autoip_tmr() all AUTOIP_TMR_INTERVAL msces,
that should be defined in autoip.h. I recommend a value of 100. The value must
divide 1000 with a remainder almost 0. Possible values are 1000, 500, 333, 250,
200, 166, 142, 125, 111, 100 .... Without DHCP: - Call autoip_start() after
netif_add(). With DHCP: - define LWIP_DHCP_AUTOIP_COOP 1 in your lwipopts.h. -
Configure your DHCP Client. /

support v2 since now V1 is very old (August 1989) V1 can be added if required a
debug print and statistic have been implemented to show this up. Note 2) A query
for a specific group address (as opposed to ALLHOSTS) has now been implemented
as I am unsure if it is required a debug print and statistic have been
implemented to show this up. Note 3) The router alert rfc 2113 is implemented in
outgoing packets but not checked rigorously incoming Steve Reynolds RFC 988 -

@file SNMP output message processing (RFC1157). Output responses and traps are
build in two passes: Pass 0: iterate over the output message backwards to
determine encoding lengths Pass 1: the actual forward encoding of internal form
into ASN1 The single-pass encoding method described by Comer & Stevens requires
extra buffer space and copying for reversal of the packet. The buffer
requirement can be prohibitively large for big payloads (> 484) therefore we use
the two encoding passes. / Copyright (c) 2006 Axon Digital Design B.V., The

/ @defgroup httpd HTTP server @ingroup apps This httpd supports for a
rudimentary server-side-include facility which will replace tags of the form <!
--tag in any file whose extension is .shtml, .shtm or .ssi with strings provided
by an include handler whose pointer is provided to the module via function
http_set_ssi_handler(). Additionally, a simple common gateway interface (CGI)
handling mechanism has been added to allow clients to hook functions to
particular request URIs. To enable SSI support, define label LWIP_HTTPD_SSI in
lwipopts.h. To enable CGI support, define label LWIP_HTTPD_CGI in lwipopts.h. By
default, the server assumes that HTTP headers are already present in each file
stored in the file system. By defining LWIP_HTTPD_DYNAMIC_HEADERS in lwipopts.h,
this behavior can be changed such that the server inserts the headers
automatically based on the extension of the file being served. If this mode is
used, be careful to ensure that the file system image used does not already
contain the header information. File system images without headers can be
created using the makefsfile tool with the -h command line option. Notes about
valid SSI tags The following assumptions are made about tags used in SSI
markers: 1. No tag may contain '-' or whitespace characters within the tag name.
2. Whitespace is allowed between the tag leadin "<!--" and the start of the tag
name and between the tag name and the leadout string "". 3. The maximum tag name
length is LWIP_HTTPD_MAX_TAG_NAME_LEN, currently 8 characters. Notes on CGI
usage The simple CGI support offered here works with GET method requests only
and can handle up to 16 parameters encoded into the URI. The handler function
may not write directly to the HTTP output but must return a filename that the
HTTP server will send to the browser as a response to the incoming CGI request.
The list of supported file types is quite short, so if makefsdata complains
about an unknown extension, make sure to add it (and its doctype) to the
'g_psHTTPHeaders' list. /

snmp SNMPv2c agent @ingroup apps SNMPv2c compatible agent\n There is also a MIB
compiler and a MIB viewer in lwIP contrib repository (lwip-
contrib/apps/LwipMibCompiler).\n The agent implements the most important MIB2
MIBs including IPv6 support (interfaces, UDP, TCP, SNMP, ICMP, SYSTEM). IP MIB
is an older version whithout IPv6 statistics (TODO).\n Rewritten by Martin
Hentschel <info@cl-soft.de> and Dirk Ziegelmeier <dziegel@gmx.de>\n Work on
SNMPv3 has started, but is not finished.\n 0 Agent Capabilities Features: -
SNMPv2c support. - Low RAM usage - no memory pools, stack only. - MIB2
implementation is separated from SNMP stack. - Support for multiple MIBs
(snmp_set_mibs() call) - e.g. for private MIB. - Simple and generic API for MIB
implementation. - Comfortable node types and helper functions for scalar arrays
and tables. - Counter64, bit and truthvalue datatype support. - Callbacks for
SNMP writes e.g. to implement persistency. - Runs on two APIs: RAW and netconn.
- Async API is gone - the stack now supports netconn API instead, so blocking
operations can be done in MIB calls. SNMP runs in a worker thread when netconn
API is used. - Simplified thread sync support for MIBs - useful when MIBs need
to access variables shared with other threads where no locking is possible. Used
in MIB2 to access lwIP stats from lwIP thread. MIB compiler (code generator): -
Provided in lwIP contrib repository. - Written in C. MIB viewer used Windows
Forms. - Developed on Windows with Visual Studio 2010. - Can be compiled and
used on all platforms with http://www.monodevelop.com/. - Based on a heavily
modified version of of SharpSnmpLib (a4bd05c6afb4) (https://sharpsnmplib.codeple
x.com/SourceControl/network/forks/Nemo157/MIBParserUpdate). - MIB parser, C file
generation framework and LWIP code generation are cleanly separated, which means
the code may be useful as a base for code generation of other SNMP agents.
Notes: - Stack and MIB compiler were used to implement a Profinet device.
Compiled/implemented MIBs: LLDP-MIB, LLDP-EXT-DOT3-MIB, LLDP-EXT-PNO-MIB. SNMPv1
per RFC1157 and SNMPv2c per RFC 3416 Note the S in SNMP stands for "Simple".
Note that "Simple" is relative. SNMP is simple compared to the complex ISO
network management protocols CMIP (Common Management Information Protocol) and
CMOT (CMip Over Tcp). MIB II The standard lwIP stack management information
base. This is a required MIB, so this is always enabled. The groups EGP, CMOT
and transmission are disabled by default. Most mib-2 objects are not writable
except: sysName, sysLocation, sysContact, snmpEnableAuthenTraps. Writing to or
changing the ARP and IP address and route tables is not possible. Note lwIP has
a very limited notion of IP routing. It currently doen't have a route table and
doesn't have a notion of the U,G,H flags. Instead lwIP uses the interface list
with only one default interface acting as a single gateway interface (G) for the
default route. The agent returns a "virtual table" with the default route
0.0.0.0 for the default interface and network routes (no H) for each network
interface in the netif_list. All routes are considered to be up (U). Loading
additional MIBs MIBs can only be added in compile-time, not in run-time. 1
Building the Agent First of all you'll need to add the following define to your
local lwipopts.h: \define LWIP_SNMP 1 and add the source files your makefile.
Note you'll might need to adapt you network driver to update the mib2 variables
for your interface. 2 Running the Agent The following function calls must be
made in your program to actually get the SNMP agent running. Before starting the
agent you should supply pointers for sysContact, sysLocation, and
snmpEnableAuthenTraps. You can do this by calling - snmp_mib2_set_syscontact() -
snmp_mib2_set_syslocation() - snmp_set_auth_traps_enabled() You can register a
callback which is called on successful write access: snmp_set_write_callback().
Additionally you may want to set - snmp_mib2_set_sysdescr() -
snmp_set_device_enterprise_oid() - snmp_mib2_set_sysname() Also before starting
the agent you need to setup one or more trap destinations using these calls: -
snmp_trap_dst_enable() - snmp_trap_dst_ip_set() If you need more than MIB2, set
the MIBs you want to use by snmp_set_mibs(). Finally, enable the agent by
calling snmp_init() @defgroup snmp_core Core @ingroup snmp @defgroup snmp_traps
Traps @ingroup snmp /

@file DNS - host name to IP address resolver. @defgroup dns DNS @ingroup
callbackstyle_api Implements a DNS host name to IP address resolver. The lwIP
DNS resolver functions are used to lookup a host name and map it to a numerical
IP address. It maintains a list of resolved hostnames that can be queried with
the dns_lookup() function. New hostnames can be resolved using the dns_query()
function. The lwIP version of the resolver also adds a non-blocking version of
gethostbyname() that will work with a raw API application. This function checks
for an IP address string first and converts it if it is valid. gethostbyname()
then does a dns_lookup() to see if the name is already in the table. If so, the
IP is returned. If not, a query is issued and the function returns with a
ERR_INPROGRESS status. The app using the dns client must then go into a waiting
state. Once a hostname has been resolved (or found to be non-existent), the
resolver code calls a specified callback function (which must be implemented by
the module that uses the resolver). Multicast DNS queries are supported for
names ending on ".local". However, only "One-Shot Multicast DNS Queries" are
supported (RFC 6762 chapter 5.1), this is not a fully compliant implementation
of continuous mDNS querying! All functions must be called from TCPIP thread.

@file Packet buffer management / @defgroup pbuf Packet buffers (PBUF) @ingroup
infrastructure Packets are built from the pbuf data structure. It supports
dynamic memory allocation for packet contents or can reference externally
managed packet contents both in RAM and ROM. Quick allocation for incoming
packets is provided through pools with fixed sized pbufs. A packet may span over
multiple pbufs, chained as a singly linked list. This is called a "pbuf chain".
Multiple packets may be queued, also using this singly linked list. This is
called a "packet queue". So, a packet queue consists of one or more pbuf chains,
each of which consist of one or more pbufs. CURRENTLY, PACKET QUEUES ARE NOT
SUPPORTED!!! Use helper structs to queue multiple packets. The differences
between a pbuf chain and a packet queue are very precise but subtle. The last
pbuf of a packet has a ->tot_len field that equals the ->len field. It can be
found by traversing the list. If the last pbuf of a packet has a ->next field
other than NULL, more packets are on the queue. Therefore, looping through a
pbuf of a single packet, has an loop end condition (tot_len p->len), NOT (next
NULL). Example of custom pbuf usage for zero-copy RX: @code{.c} typedef struct
my_custom_pbuf { struct pbuf_custom p; void dma_descriptor; } my_custom_pbuf_t;
LWIP_MEMPOOL_DECLARE(RX_POOL, 10, sizeof(my_custom_pbuf_t), "Zero-copy RX PBUF

DHCP_COARSE_TIMER_SECS (recommended 60 which is a minute) @ref
DHCP_FINE_TIMER_MSECS (recommended 500 which equals TCP coarse timer)
dhcp_start() starts a DHCP client instance which configures the interface by
obtaining an IP address lease and maintaining it. Use dhcp_release() to end the
lease and use dhcp_stop() to remove the DHCP client. @see netifapi_dhcp4 /

@ingroup addons This is an arch independent SLIP netif. The specific serial
hooks must be provided by another file. They are sio_open, sio_read/sio_tryread
and sio_send Usage: This netif can be used in three ways:\n 1) For NO_SYS0, an
RX thread can be used which blocks on sio_read() until data is received.\n 2) In
your main loop, call slipif_poll() to check for new RX bytes, completed packets
are fed into netif->input().\n 3) Call slipif_received_byte[s]() from your
serial RX ISR and slipif_process_rxqueue() from your main loop. ISR level
decodes packets and puts completed packets on a queue which is fed into the
stack from the main loop (needs SYS_LIGHTWEIGHT_PROT for pbuf_alloc to work on
ISR level!). /

lpesonen@clinet.fi, april 1997 Implemented LANManager type password response to
MS-CHAP challenges. Now pppd provides both NT style and LANMan style blocks, and
the prefered is set by option "ms-lanman". Default is to use NT. The hash text
(StdText) was taken from Win95 RASAPI32.DLL. You should also use
DOMAIN\\USERNAME as described in README.MSCHAP80 / Modifications by Frank
Cusack, frank@google.com, March 2002. Implemented MS-CHAPv2 functionality,
heavily based on sample implementation in RFC 2759. Implemented MPPE

OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Original version by James
Carlson This implementation of EAP supports MD5-Challenge and SRP-SHA1
authentication styles. Note that support of MD5-Challenge is a requirement of
RFC 2284, and that it's essentially just a reimplementation of regular RFC 1994
CHAP using EAP messages. As an authenticator ("server"), there are multiple
phases for each style. In the first phase of each style, the unauthenticated
peer name is queried using the EAP Identity request type. If the "remotename"
option is used, then this phase is skipped, because the peer's name is presumed
to be known. For MD5-Challenge, there are two phases, and the second phase
consists of sending the challenge itself and handling the associated response.
For SRP-SHA1, there are four phases. The second sends 's', 'N', and 'g'. The
reply contains 'A'. The third sends 'B', and the reply contains 'M1'. The forth
sends the 'M2' value. As an authenticatee ("client"), there's just a single
phase responding to the queries generated by the peer. EAP is an authenticator-
driven protocol. Based on draft-ietf-pppext-eap-srp-03.txt. /

file for the RPMSG driver. This file implements APIs as defined by RPMSG
documentation(Linux docs) and also provides some utility functions. RPMSG driver
represents each processor/core to which it communicates with remote_device
control block. Each remote device(processor) defines its role in the
communication i.e whether it is RPMSG Master or Remote. If the device(processor)
to which driver is talking is RPMSG master then RPMSG driver implicitly behaves
as Remote and vice versa. RPMSG Master is responsible for initiating
communications with the Remote and shared buffers management. Terms remote
device/core/proc are used interchangeably for the processor to which RPMSG
driver is communicating irrespective of the fact whether it is RPMSG Remote or
Master. /

THIS COPYRIGHT NOTICE AND DISCLAIMER MUST BE RETAINED AS PART OF THIS FILE AT

@note - The example is tested on ML403 and ML507 evaluation boards. The push
buttons SW3,SW4,SW5 and SW7 on the ML403 evaluation board are used in the
example for the key action of the USB keyboard.The push buttons SW10, SW11,
SW12, SW13 and SW14 are used on the ML507 board. The example sends a character
from a fixed sequence of characters from the device as and when any of the SW3
or SW4 or SW5 and SW7 push button is pressed. The fixed sequence of characters
is XILINX USB KEYBOARD DEMO. The SW6 push button switch is used to complete the
test. SW14 is used on ML507 board to complete the test. - The GPIO device has to
be added to the hardware design so that the push buttons on the evaluation board
could be used. If we enable the debug statements in the xusb_cp9.c file, we must
add the UARTLite core to the hardware design. Debug messages can be enabled by
defining the constant XUSB_DEBUG, - To run this example, the evaluation board is
to be connected to a windows Host PC over the USB port. - The example configures
the USB device for endpoint 0 and endpoint 1. Endpoint 0 is the control endpoint
and is configured for a maximum packet length of 64 bytes. End point 1 is
configured for INTERRUPT IN transactions and the maximum packet size is
configured as 16 bytes. - The USB keyboard example code has to be compiled along
with the xusb_cp9.c file. The xusb_cp9.c file contains all the USB enumeration
related functions. To compile the code for USB keyboard example, the constant
definitions HID_DEVICES and USB_KEYBOARD are to be defined and the definitions
the constants USB_MOUSE and MASS_STORAGE_DEVICE are to be undefined. These
definitions can be found in the xusb_types.h file. <pre> MODIFICATION HISTORY:

THIS COPYRIGHT NOTICE AND DISCLAIMER MUST BE RETAINED AS PART OF THIS FILE AT
ALL TIMES. @file xusb_mouse.c This file contains an example for USB Mouse. @note
- The example is tested on ML403 and ML507 evaluation boards. The push buttons
SW3,SW4,SW5 and SW7 on the ML403 evaluation board are used in the example for
the mouse movement of the USB mouse. The push buttons used on ML507 board are
SW10,SW11 SW12,SW13 and SW14. The cursor on the host PC moves as and when any of
the SW3 or SW4 or SW5 and SW7 push button is pressed. The SW6 push button switch
is used to complete the test. The push buttons on the ML507 board for cursor
movement are SW10, SW11, SW 12 and SW13. The push button for completing the test
is SW14. - The GPIO device has to be added to the hardware design so that the
push buttons on the evaluation board could be used. If we enable the debug
statements in the xusb_cp9.c file, we must add the UARTLite core to the hardware
design. Debug messages can be enabled by defining the constant XUSB_DEBUG, - To
run this example, the evaluation board is to be connected to a windows Host PC
over the USB port. - The example configures the USB device for endpoint 0 and
endpoint 1. Endpoint 0 is the control endpoint and is configured for a maximum
packet length of 64 bytes. End point 1 is configured for INTERRUPT IN
transactions and the maximum packet size is configured as 16 bytes. - The USB
mouse example code has to be compiled along with the xusb_cp9.c file. The
xusb_cp9.c file contains all the USB enumeration related functions. To compile
the code for USB mouse example, the constant definitions HID_DEVICES and
USB_MOUSE are to be defined and the definitions the constants USB_KEYBOARD and
MASS_STORAGE_DEVICE are to be undefined. These definitions can be found in the
xusb_types.h file. <pre> MODIFICATION HISTORY: Ver Who Date Changes ----- ----

THIS COPYRIGHT NOTICE AND DISCLAIMER MUST BE RETAINED AS PART OF THIS FILE AT
ALL TIMES. @file xusb.h @addtogroup usb_v5_2 @{ @details This file contains the
implementation of the XUsb component. It is the driver for the USB device
controller. The USB device controller supports the following features: - USB 2.0
Specification supporting High/Full/Low Speed - 8 Endpoints - 1 Control Endpoint
- 7 Configurable Endpoints, which can be configured as IN or OUT , and
configurable as Interrupt or Bulk or Isochronous - 2 Ping Pong Buffers for all
the endpoints except the Control Endpoint <b>Initialization & Configuration</b>
The device driver enables higher layer software (e.g., an application) to
communicate to the USB device. Apart from transmission and reception of USB
frames the driver also handles the configuration of the device. A single device
driver can support multiple USB devices. XUsb_CfgInitialize() API is used to
initialize the USB device. The user needs to first call the XUsb_LookupConfig()
API which returns the Configuration structure pointer which is passed as a
parameter to the XUsb_CfgInitialize() API. - Configuration of the DEVICE
endpoints: The endpoints of the device need to be configured using the
XUsb_EpConfigure() function call. After configuration is complete, the endpoints
need to be initialized using the XUsb_EpInitializeAll() function call. <b> PHY
Communication </b> As the H/W doesn't give any provision for the driver to
configure the PHY, the driver doesn't provide any mechanism for directly
programming the PHY. <b> DMA </b> The USB device has an inbuilt DMA. It's a
simple DMA for data transfer between endpoint buffer memory and the external
memory. The driver has two APIs for DMA operation. one API is used for resetting
the DMA module of the USB device. The other API is for initiating the DMA
transfer. The DMA transfer API is internal to the driver and is used by the USB
endpoint data send and data receive functions. Upon completion of DMA transfer
the USB device sets the buffer ready bit of the endpoint for which the DMA
transfer is initiated. Setting of the buffer ready bit enables
transmission/reception of an endpoint data. To enable the USB device to know to
which endpoint the current DMA transfer is initiated, the driver writes the
buffer ready mask to the DMA control register. The DMA in the device can be
enabled or disabled only during the system build time. <b> Interrupts </b> The
driver provides an interrupt handler XUsb_IntrHandler for handling the interrupt
from the USB device. The users of this driver have to register this handler with
the interrupt system and provide the callback functions. The interrupt handlers
and associated callback functions for the USB device have to be registered by
the user using the XUsb_IntrSetHandler() function and/or XUsb_EpSetHandler()
function. XUsb_IntrSetHandler() function installs an asynchronous callback
function for the general interrupts (interrupts other than the endpoint
interrupts). XUsb_EpSetHandler() function installs the callback functions for
the interrupts related to the endpoint events. A separate callback function has
to be installed for each of the endpoints. <b> Virtual Memory </b> This driver
supports Virtual Memory. The RTOS is responsible for calculating the correct
device base address in Virtual Memory space. <b> Threads </b> This driver is not
thread safe. Any needs for threads or thread mutual exclusion must be satisfied
by the layer above this driver. <b> Asserts </b> Asserts are used within all
Xilinx drivers to enforce constraints on argument values. Asserts can be turned
off on a system-wide basis by defining, at compile time, the NDEBUG identifier.
By default, asserts are turned on and it is recommended that users leave asserts
on during development. <b> Building the driver </b> The XUsb driver is composed
of several source files. This allows the user to build and link only those parts
of the driver that are necessary. <pre> MODIFICATION HISTORY: Ver Who Date
Changes ----- ---- -------- 1.00a hvm 02/22/07 First release. 1.01a hvm 05/30/07
The chapter 9 files are moved to examples directory. 1.01a sdm 08/22/08 Removed
support for static interrupt handlers from the MDD file 1.01a hvm 10/02/08 The
Buffer0Ready, Buffer1Ready are declared as volatile. In function
XUsb_EpDataRecv, the initialization of Buffer0Ready, Buffer1Ready and CurBufNum
variables is moved before the buffer ready bit is set in the buffer ready
register. Added the initialization of Buffer0Ready, Buffer1Ready and CurBufNum
variables in the XUsb_EpDataSecd function. 2.00a hvm 10/22/08 Added Support for
the new XPS USB device. The new device has support for DMA. Apart from the DMA,
remote wakeup feature is also added the USB device. However, there is no
additional code needed to be added in the driver to support this feature. 3.00a
hvm 12/03/09 Added the modifications related to the new USB error reporting
register in the XPS USB device. Updated to use HAL processor APIs. Removed _m
from the name of the macros. XUsb_mReadReg is renamed to XUsb_ReadReg and
XUsb_mWriteReg is renamed to XUsb_WriteReg. 3.01a hvm 5/20/10 Updated with fix

sec_init Initialization and Configuration The XSdFec_Config structure is used by
the driver to configure the FEC mode and interface parameters defined for each
SD-FEC device. The configuration structure is created by the tool-chain based on
HW build properties. To support multiple runtime loading and initialization
strategies employed by various operating systems, the driver instance can be
initialized in one of two ways: - XSdFecInitialize(InstancePtr, DeviceId) - The
driver looks up its own configuration structure created by the tool-chain based
on an ID provided by the tool-chain. - XSdFecCfgInitialize(InstancePtr, CfgPtr)
- Uses a configuration structure provided by the caller. \section sec_data Data
Structures One or more device specific headers are produced during the
generation of the board support package, defining further device specific
configuration parameters: - When the device is configured for Turbo Decode, the
header x<ipinst_name>_turbo_params.h, contains an XSdFecturbo_parameters
structure which is populated to match the corresponding IP GUI configuration. -
When the device is configured for LDPC a header is generated per LDPC code
specified on the corresponding IP GUI; x<ipinst_name >_<code_id>_params.h. Each
header defines an XSdFecldpc_parameters structure populated with the
configuration data required for the corresponding LDPC code. \section sec_api
API The driver provides the following functions: -
XSdFecSetTurboParams(InstancePtr, ParamsPtr) - Set Turbo parameters on a device
- XSdFecadd_ldpc_params(InstancePtr, CodeId, SCOffset, LAOffset, QCOffset,
ParamsPtr) - Add LDPC parameters to a device - XSdFecShareTableSize(ParamsPtr,
SCSizePtr, LASizePtr, QCSizePtr) - Calculate share table size for a LDPC code -
XSdFecInterruptClassifier(InstancePtr) - Classify interrupts In addition, the
driver provides set and get functions for all the individual registers defined
for the SD-FEC. \section sec_ex Example The processor based example design
output by the SD-FEC IP instance also includes an example application
demonstrating a basic use case of the software driver. /

remote side of the IPI latency measurement demo. This demo does the follwing
steps: 1. Open the shared memory device. 1. Open the TTC timer device. 2. Open
the IPI device. 3. Register IPI interrupt handler. 6. When it receives IPI
interrupt, the IPI interrupt handler to stop the RPU to APU TTC counter. 7.
Check the shared memory to see if demo is on. If the demo is on, reest the RPU
to APU TTC counter and kick IPI to notify the remote. 8. If the shared memory
indicates the demo is off, cleanup resource: disable IPI interrupt and
deregister the IPI interrupt handler. /

application that showcases usage of rpmsg This application is meant to run on
the remote CPU running FreeRTOS code. It echoes back data that was sent to it by
the master core. The application calls init_system which defines a shared memory
region in MPU settings for the communication between master and remote using
zynqMP_r5_map_mem_region API,it also initializes interrupt controller GIC and
register the interrupt service routine for IPI using zynqMP_r5_gic_initialize
API. Echo test calls the remoteproc_resource_init API to create the virtio/RPMsg
devices required for IPC with the master context. Invocation of this API causes
remoteproc on the FreeRTOS to use the rpmsg name service announcement feature to
advertise the rpmsg channels served by the application. The master receives the
advertisement messages and performs the following tasks: 1. Invokes the channel
created callback registered by the master application 2. Responds to remote
context with a name service acknowledgement message After the acknowledgement is
received from master, remoteproc on the FreeRTOS invokes the RPMsg channel-
created callback registered by the remote application. The RPMsg channel is
established at this point. All RPMsg APIs can be used subsequently on both sides
for run time communications between the master and remote software contexts.
Upon running the master application to send data to remote core, master will
generate the payload and send to remote (FreeRTOS) by informing the FreeRTOS
with an IPI, the remote will send the data back by master and master will
perform a check whether the same data is received. Once the application is ran
and task by the FreeRTOS application is done, master needs to properly shut down
the remote processor To shut down the remote processor, the following steps are
performed: 1. The master application sends an application-specific shut-down
message to the remote context 2. This FreeRTOS application cleans up application
resources, sends a shut-down acknowledge to master, and invokes
remoteproc_resource_deinit API to de-initialize remoteproc on the FreeRTOS side.
3. On receiving the shut-down acknowledge message, the master application
invokes the remoteproc_shutdown API to shut down the remote processor and de-
initialize remoteproc using remoteproc_deinit on its side.

memory region in MPU settings for the communication between master and remote
using zynqMP_r5_map_mem_region API,it also initializes interrupt controller GIC
and register the interrupt service routine for IPI using
zynqMP_r5_gic_initialize API. Echo test calls the remoteproc_resource_init API
to create the virtio/RPMsg devices required for IPC with the master context.
Invocation of this API causes remoteproc on the bare-metal to use the rpmsg name
service announcement feature to advertise the rpmsg channels served by the
application. The master receives the advertisement messages and performs the
following tasks: 1. Invokes the channel created callback registered by the
master application 2. Responds to remote context with a name service
acknowledgement message After the acknowledgement is received from master,
remoteproc on the bare-metal invokes the RPMsg channel-created callback
registered by the remote application. The RPMsg channel is established at this
point. All RPMsg APIs can be used subsequently on both sides for run time
communications between the master and remote software contexts. Upon running the
master application to send data to remote core, master will generate the payload
and send to remote (bare-metal) by informing the bare-metal with an IPI, the
remote will send the data back by master and master will perform a check whether
the same data is received. Once the application is ran and task by the bare-
metal application is done, master needs to properly shut down the remote
processor To shut down the remote processor, the following steps are performed:
1. The master application sends an application-specific shut-down message to the
remote context 2. This bare-metal application cleans up application resources,
sends a shut-down acknowledge to master, and invokes remoteproc_resource_deinit
API to de-initialize remoteproc on the bare-metal side. 3. On receiving the
shut-down acknowledge message, the master application invokes the
remoteproc_shutdown API to shut down the remote processor and de-initialize
remoteproc using remoteproc_deinit on its side.

R0.02 Added FAT12 support. Removed unbuffered mode. Fixed a problem on small
(<32M) partition. Jun 10,'06 R0.02a Added a configuration option (_FS_MINIMUM).
Sep 22,'06 R0.03 Added f_rename(). Changed option _FS_MINIMUM to _FS_MINIMIZE.
Dec 11,'06 R0.03a Improved cluster scan algorithm to write files fast. Fixed
f_mkdir() creates incorrect directory on FAT32. Feb 04,'07 R0.04 Supported
multiple drive system. Changed some interfaces for multiple drive system.
Changed f_mountdrv() to f_mount(). Added f_mkfs(). Apr 01,'07 R0.04a Supported
multiple partitions on a physical drive. Added a capability of extending file
size to f_lseek(). Added minimization level 3. Fixed an endian sensitive code in
f_mkfs(). May 05,'07 R0.04b Added a configuration option _USE_NTFLAG. Added
FSINFO support. Fixed DBCS name can result FR_INVALID_NAME. Fixed short seek (<
csize) collapses the file object. Aug 25,'07 R0.05 Changed arguments of
f_read(), f_write() and f_mkfs(). Fixed f_mkfs() on FAT32 creates incorrect
FSINFO. Fixed f_mkdir() on FAT32 creates incorrect directory. Feb 03,'08 R0.05a
Added f_truncate() and f_utime(). Fixed off by one error at FAT sub-type
determination. Fixed btr in f_read() can be mistruncated. Fixed cached sector is
not flushed when create and close without write. Apr 01,'08 R0.06 Added fputc(),
fputs(), fprintf() and fgets(). Improved performance of f_lseek() on moving to
the same or following cluster. Apr 01,'09 R0.07 Merged Tiny-FatFs as a
configuration option. (_FS_TINY) Added long file name feature. Added multiple
code page feature. Added re-entrancy for multitask operation. Added auto cluster
size selection to f_mkfs(). Added rewind option to f_readdir(). Changed result
code of critical errors. Renamed string functions to avoid name collision. Apr
14,'09 R0.07a Separated out OS dependent code on reentrant cfg. Added multiple
sector size feature. Jun 21,'09 R0.07c Fixed f_unlink() can return FR_OK on
error. Fixed wrong cache control in f_lseek(). Added relative path feature.
Added f_chdir() and f_chdrive(). Added proper case conversion to extended
character. Nov 03,'09 R0.07e Separated out configuration options from ff.h to
ffconf.h. Fixed f_unlink() fails to remove a sub-directory on _FS_RPATH. Fixed
name matching error on the 13 character boundary. Added a configuration option,
_LFN_UNICODE. Changed f_readdir() to return the SFN with always upper case on
non-LFN cfg. May 15,'10 R0.08 Added a memory configuration option. (_USE_LFN 3)
Added file lock feature. (_FS_SHARE) Added fast seek feature. (_USE_FASTSEEK)
Changed some types on the API, XCHAR->TCHAR. Changed .fname in the FILINFO
structure on Unicode cfg. String functions support UTF-8 encoding files on
Unicode cfg. Aug 16,'10 R0.08a Added f_getcwd(). Added sector erase feature.
(_USE_ERASE) Moved file lock semaphore table from fs object to the bss. Fixed a
wrong directory entry is created on non-LFN cfg when the given name contains
';'. Fixed f_mkfs() creates wrong FAT32 volume. Jan 15,'11 R0.08b Fast seek
feature is also applied to f_read() and f_write(). f_lseek() reports required
table size on creating CLMP. Extended format syntax of f_printf(). Ignores
duplicated directory separators in given path name. Sep 06,'11 R0.09 f_mkfs()
supports multiple partition to complete the multiple partition feature. Added
f_fdisk(). Aug 27,'12 R0.09a Changed f_open() and f_opendir() reject null object
pointer to avoid crash. Changed option name _FS_SHARE to _FS_LOCK. Fixed
assertion failure due to OS/2 EA on FAT12/16 volume. Jan 24,'13 R0.09b Added
f_setlabel() and f_getlabel(). Oct 02,'13 R0.10 Added selection of character
encoding on the file. (_STRF_ENCODE) Added f_closedir(). Added forced full FAT
scan for f_getfree(). (_FS_NOFSINFO) Added forced mount feature with changes of
f_mount(). Improved behavior of volume auto detection. Improved write throughput
of f_puts() and f_printf(). Changed argument of f_chdrive(), f_mkfs(),
disk_read() and disk_write(). Fixed f_write() can be truncated when the file
size is close to 4GB. Fixed f_open(), f_mkdir() and f_setlabel() can return
incorrect error code. Jan 15,'14 R0.10a Added arbitrary strings as drive number
in the path name. (_STR_VOLUME_ID) Added a configuration option of minimum
sector size. (_MIN_SS) 2nd argument of f_rename() can have a drive number and it
will be ignored. Fixed f_mount() with forced mount fails when drive number is >
1. Fixed f_close() invalidates the file object without volume lock. Fixed
f_closedir() returns but the volume lock is left acquired. Fixed creation of an
entry with LFN fails on too many SFN collisions. May 19,'14 R0.10b Fixed a hard
error in the disk I/O layer can collapse the directory entry. Fixed LFN entry is
not deleted on delete/rename an object with lossy converted SFN.
