*
* The Xilinx Partial Reconfiguration Decoupler driver can be used to provide a
* boundary between the static logic and a Reconfigurable Partition during
* Partial Reconfiguration.
*
* The PR Decoupler supports the following features:
* - All Interface types registered in the Vivado Design Suite are supported,
*   including custom interfaces.
* - Non-Vivado Design Suite interfaces are supported.
* - The decoupling behaviour can be configured for each interface.
* - Each interface can have Clock Domain Crossing support.
* - Optional AXI4-Stream based control.
* - Optional AXI4-Stream based Status.
* - Optional AXI4-Lite based status and control.
*
* <b> Initialization and Configuration </b>
*
*    - XPrd_LookupConfig(DeviceId) - Use the device identifier to find the
*      static configuration structure defined in xprd_g.c. This is setup by
*      the tools. For some operating systems the config structure will be
*      initialized by the software and this call is not needed.
*
*    - XPrd_CfgInitialize() is used for initialisation. The user needs to first
*      call the XPrd_LookupConfig() which returns the Configuration structure
*      pointer which is passed as a parameter to the XPrd_CfgInitialize().
*
* <b> Threads </b>
*
* This driver is not thread safe. Any needs for threads or thread mutual
* exclusion must be satisfied by the layer above this driver.
*
* <b> Asserts </b>
*
* Asserts are used within all Xilinx drivers to enforce constraints on argument
* values. Asserts can be turned off on a system-wide basis by defining, at
* compile time, the NDEBUG identifier. By default, asserts are turned on and it
* is recommended that users leave asserts on during development.
*
* <b> Building the driver </b>
*
* The XPrd driver is composed of several source files. This allows the user
* to build and link only those parts of the driver that are necessary.

*
* MODIFICATION HISTORY:
*
* Ver   Who     Date          Changes
* ----- -----  -----------   ---------------------------------------------
* 1.0   ms     07/14/16      First release
* 1.1   ms     01/16/17      Updated the parameter naming from
*                            XPAR_PR_DECOUPLER_NUM_INSTANCES to
*                            XPAR_XPRD_NUM_INSTANCES to avoid compilation
*                            failure for XPAR_PR_DECOUPLER_NUM_INSTANCES as the
*                            tools are generating XPAR_XPRD_NUM_INSTANCES
*                            in the generated xprd_g.c for fixing MISRA-C
*                            files. This is a fix for CR-966099 based on the
*                            update in the tools.
*       ms     03/17/17      Added readme.txt file in examples folder for
*                            doxygen generation.
*       ms     04/05/2017    Modified comment lines notation in functions
*                            of prd examples to avoid unnecessary description
*                            which was displayed while generating doxygen.
