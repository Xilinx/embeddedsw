/** \page example Examples
You can refer to the below stated example applications for more details on how to use iicps driver.

@section ex1 xiicps_selftest_example.c
Contains an example on how to use the XIicps driver directly.
This example performs the basic selftest using the driver.

For details, see xiicps_selftest_example.c.

@section ex2 xiicps_eeprom_intr_example.c
Contains an example on how to use the XIicps driver directly.
This example consists of a interrutp mode design which shows the
usage of the Xilinx PS iic device and XIicPs driver to exercise
the EEPROM.

For details, see xiicps_eeprom_intr_example.c.

@section ex3 xiicps_eeprom_polled_example.c
Contains an example on how to use the XIicps driver directly.
This example consists of a polled mode design which shows the
usage of the Xilinx PS iic device and XIicPs driver to exercise
the EEPROM.

For details, see xiicps_eeprom_polled_example.c.

@section ex4 xiicps_intr_master_example.c

interrupt-driven mode.

For details, see xiicps_intr_master_example.c.

@section ex5 xiicps_intr_slave_example.c
Contains an example on how to use the XIicps driver directly.
This example shows the usage of the iic device as slave for
interrupt-driven transfers using the external Aardvark iic
analyzer as the master.

For details, see xiicps_intr_slave_example.c.
