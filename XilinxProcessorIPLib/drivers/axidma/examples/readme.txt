/** \page example Examples
You can refer to the below stated example applications for more details on how to use axidma driver.

@section ex1 xaxidma_example_selftest.c
Contains an example on how to use the XAxidma driver directly.
This example performs the basic selftest on the device using the
driver.

For details, see xaxidma_example_selftest.c.

@section ex2 xaxidma_example_sg_intr.c
Contains an example on how to use the XAxidma driver directly.
This example shows the usage of the driver to transfer
packets in interrupt mode when the axidma is configured in
scatter gather mode.

For details, see xaxidma_example_sg_intr.c.

@section ex3 xaxidma_example_sg_poll.c
Contains an example on how to use the XAxidma driver directly.
This example shows the usage of the driver to transfer
packets in polling mode when the axidma is configured in
scatter gather mode.

For details, see xaxidma_example_sg_poll.c.

@section ex4 xaxidma_example_simple_intr.c
Contains an example on how to use the XAxidma driver directly.
This example shows the usage of the driver to transfer
packets in interrupt mode when the axidma is configured in
simple mode.

For details, see xaxidma_example_simple_intr.c.

@section ex5 xaxidma_example_simple_poll.c
Contains an example on how to use the XAxidma driver directly.
This example shows the usage of the driver to transfer
packets in polling mode when the axidma is configured in
simple mode.

For details, see xaxidma_example_simple_poll.c.

@section ex6 xaxidma_example_multichan_sg_intr.c
Contains an example on how to use the XAxidma driver directly.
This example shows the usage of the driver to transfer
packets in interrupt mode for multichannel capability and works
only when the axidma core is configured in scatter gather mode
and multichannel mode.

For details, see xaxidma_example_multichan_sg_intr.c.

@section ex7 xaxidma_example_poll_multi_pkts.c
Contains an example on how to use the XAxidma driver directly.
This example shows the usage of the driver to transfer
multiple packets in polling mode when the axidma core is
configured in Scatter Gather Mode.

For details, see xaxidma_example_poll_multi_pkts.c.

@section ex8 xaxidma_example_sgcyclic_intr.c
Contains an example on how to use the XAxidma driver directly.
This example shows the usage of the driver to transfer
packets in cyclic in interrupt mode when the axidma is
configured in scatter gather mode.

For details, see xaxidma_example_sgcyclic_intr.c.
