/** \page example Examples
You can refer to the below stated example applications for more details on how to use v_mix driver.

@section ex1 main.c
Contains an example on how to use the XV_mix driver directly.
This example shows the usage of the Mixer IP available in catalogue.

For details, see main.c.

@section ex2 vmix_example.tcl
Contains a tcl file which automates the process of generating the downloadable
bit & elf files from the provided example hdf file.

Example application design source files (contained within "examples" folder) are
tightly coupled with the v_mix example design available in Vivado Catalogue.
To run this tcl
1. Copy the exported example design hdf file in the "examples" directory of
     the driver
2. Launch the xsct terminal
3. cd into the examples directory
4. source the tcl file
   @code xsct%>source vmix_example.tcl @endcode
5. execute the script
   @code xsct%>vmix_example <hdf_file_name.hdf> @endcode

Script will perform following operations
1. Create workspace
2. Create HW project
3. Create BSP
4. Create Application Project
5. Build BSP and Application Project

After the process is complete required files will be available in
@verbatim
  bit file -> vmix_example.sdk/vmix_example_hw_platform folder
  elf file -> vmix_example.sdk/vmix_example_design/{Debug/Release} folder
@endverbatim

When executed on the board the example application will perform following operations
1. Set Input video stream
2. Program VTC for video stream parameters
3. Program Mixer for video stream parameters
4. Program TPG to generate required video stream
5. Check for Video Lock
6. If Locked, run defined tests on video mixer IP
7. Repeat Steps 1-6 for defined video streams (1080p/60 and 4k2k/30)

@note Serial terminal baud rate should be set to 115200

For details, see vmix_example.tcl.
