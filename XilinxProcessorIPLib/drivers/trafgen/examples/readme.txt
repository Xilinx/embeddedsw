/** \page example Examples
You can refer to the below stated example applications for more details on how to use trafgen driver.

@section ex1 xtrafgen_interrupt_example.c
Contains an example on how to use the XTrafgen driver directly.
This example shows the usage of the driver in interrupt mode.

For details, see xtrafgen_interrupt_example.c.

@section ex2 xtrafgen_master_streaming_example.c
Contains an example on how to use the XTrafgen driver directly.
This example demonstrates how to use Streaming mode in this driver
When Configured in Master only mode.In this mode the core generates
Streaming Traffic based on the transfer length and transfer count
configured.

For details, see xtrafgen_master_streaming_example.c.

@section ex3 xtrafgen_polling_example.c
Contains an example on how to use the XTrafgen driver directly.
This example shows the usage of the driver in polled mode.

For details, see xtrafgen_polling_example.c.

@section ex4 xtrafgen_static_mode_example.c
Contains an example on how to use the XTrafgen driver directly.
This example demonstrates  how to use the Static mode in this driver.
In Static mode the core continuously generates fixed address and fixed
INCR type read and write transfers based on the burst length configured.

For details, see xtrafgen_static_mode_example.c.
