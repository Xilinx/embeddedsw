*
* This file implements the Bad Block Management(BBM) functionality. This is
* similar to the Bad Block Management which is a part of the MTD subsystem in
* Linux.  The factory marked bad blocks are scanned initially and a Bad Block
* Table(BBT) is created in the memory.  This table is also written to the flash
* so that upon reboot, the BBT is read back from the flash and loaded into the
* memory instead of scanning every time. The Bad Block Table(BBT) is written
* into one of the the last four blocks in the flash memory. The last four
* blocks are marked as Reserved so that user can't erase/program those blocks.
*
* There are two bad block tables, a primary table and a mirror table. The
* tables are versioned and incrementing version number is used to detect and
* recover from interrupted updates. Each table is stored in a separate block,
* beginning in the first page of that block. Only two blocks would be necessary
* in the absence of bad blocks within the last four; the range of four provides
* a little slack in case one or two of those blocks is bad. These blocks are
* marked as reserved and cannot be programmed by the user. A NAND Flash device
* with 3 or more factory bad blocks in the last 4 cannot be used. The bad block
* table signature is written into the spare data area of the pages containing
* bad block table so that upon rebooting the bad block table signature is
* searched and the bad block table is loaded into RAM. The signature is "Bbt0"
* for primary Bad Block Table and "1tbB" for Mirror Bad Block Table. The
* version offset follows the signature offset in the spare data area. The
* version number increments on every update to the bad block table and the
* version wraps at 0xff.
*
* Each block in the Bad Block Table(BBT) is represented by 2 bits.
* The two bits are encoded as follows in RAM BBT.
* 0'b00 -> Good Block
* 0'b01 -> Block is bad due to wear
* 0'b10 -> Reserved block
* 0'b11 -> Factory marked bad block
*
* While writing to the flash the two bits are encoded as follows.
* 0'b00 -> Factory marked bad block
* 0'b01 -> Reserved block
* 0'b10 -> Block is bad due to wear
* 0'b11 -> Good Block
*
* The user can check for the validity of the block using the API
* XNandPs_IsBlockBad and take the action based on the return value. Also user
* can update the bad block table using XNandPs_MarkBlockBad API.
