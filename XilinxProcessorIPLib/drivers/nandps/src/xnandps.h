*
* This file implements a driver for the NAND flash controller.
*
* <b>Driver Initialization</b>
*
* The function call XNandPs_CfgInitialize() should be called by the application
* before any other function in the driver. The initialization function takes
* device specific data (like device id, instance id, and base address) and
* initializes the XNandPs instance with the device specific data.
*
* <b>Device Geometry</b>
*
* NAND flash device is memory device and it is segmented into areas called
* Logical Unit(s) (LUN) and further in to blocks and pages. A NAND flash device
* can have multiple LUN. LUN is sequential raw of multiple blocks of the same
* size. A block is the smallest erasable unit of data within the Flash array of
* a LUN. The size of each block is based on a power of 2. There is no
* restriction on the number of blocks within the LUN. A block contains a number
* of pages. A page is the smallest addressable unit for read and program
* operations. The arrangement of LUN, blocks, and pages is referred to by this
* module as the part's geometry.
*
* The cells within the part can be programmed from a logic 1 to a logic 0
* and not the other way around. To change a cell back to a logic 1, the
* entire block containing that cell must be erased. When a block is erased
* all bytes contain the value 0xFF. The number of times a block can be
* erased is finite. Eventually the block will wear out and will no longer
* be capable of erasure. As of this writing, the typical flash block can
* be erased 100,000 or more times.
*
* The jobs done by this driver typically are:
*	- 8/16 bit operational mode
*	- Read, Write, and Erase operation
*	- Read, Write cache operation
*	- Read, Write Spare area operation
*	- HW Error Check and Correction (ECC)
*
* <b>Write Operation</b>
*
* The write call can be used to write a minimum of one byte and a maximum
* entire flash. If the address offset specified to write is out of flash or if
* the number of bytes specified from the offset exceed flash boundaries
* an error is reported back to the user. The write is blocking in nature in that
* the control is returned back to user only after the write operation is
* completed successfully or an error is reported.
*
* <b>Read Operation</b>
*
* The read call can be used to read a minimum of one byte and maximum of
* entire flash. If the address offset specified to read is out of flash or if
* the number of bytes specified from the offset exceed flash boundaries
* an error is reported back to the user. The read is blocking in nature in that
* the control is returned back to user only after the read operation is
* completed successfully or an error is reported.
*
* <b>Erase Operation</b>
*
* The erase operations are provided to erase a Block in the Flash memory. The
* erase call is blocking in nature in that the control is returned back to user
* only after the erase operation is completed successfully or an error is
* reported.
*
* <b>Page Cache Write Operation</b>
*
* The page cache write call is same as write call except that it uses cache
* commands to write. This enhances the performance. This operation can't be
* performed on OnDie ECC with internal ECC enabled. There is no way to disable
* internal ECC for OnDie ECC flash parts in current driver. This operation
* is tested with Spansion S34ML04G100TFI00 flash. We have to use this operation
* only on the flash parts which supports program page cache command.
*
* <b>Page Cache Read Operation</b>
*
* The page cache read call is same as read call except that it uses cache
* commands to read. This enhances the performance.
* The read cache random command is used since the HW ECC block doesn't
* support commands without address for starting ECC.
* This operation can't be performed on OnDie ECC with internal ECC enabled.
* There is no way to disable internal ECC for OnDie ECC flash parts in current
* driver. This operation is tested with Spansion S34ML04G100TFI00 flash.
* We have to use this operation only on the flash parts which supports
* read page cache command (random).
*
* <b>Write Spare Bytes Operation</b>
*
* This call writes to user specified buffer into spare bytes of a page.
*
* <b>Read Spare Bytes Operation</b>
*
* This call reads spare bytes of a page into user specified buffer.
*
* @note
*
* This driver is intended to be RTOS and processor independent. It works with
* physical addresses only. Any needs for dynamic memory management, threads,
* mutual exclusion, virtual memory, cache control, or HW write protection
* management must be satisfied by the layer above this driver.
