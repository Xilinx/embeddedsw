/**

* @file xqspips_dual_flash_stack_lqspi_example.c
*
* This file contains a design example using the QSPI driver (XQspiPs) in
* Linear QSPI mode, with two serial Flash devices in stacked mode.
* One flash s accessed at a time on a common bus by using separate selects.
* This example writes to the two flash memories in  QSPI mode and reads
* the data back from the flash memories, in Linear QSPI mode.
* It is recommended to use Manual CS + Auto start for best performance.
*
* The hardware which this example runs on, must have a serial Flash (Numonyx
* N25Q, Winbond W25Q, Spansion S25FL, ISSI IS25WP) for it to run. This example
* has been tested with the Numonyx Serial Flash (N25Q128) and IS25WP series
* flash parts.
*

* ----- --- -------- -----------------------------------------------
* 2.02a hk  05/07/13 First release
*       ms  04/05/17 Modified Comment lines in functions to
*                    recognize it as documentation block and modified
*                    filename tag to include the file in doxygen examples.
* 3.5	tjs 07/16/18 Added support for low density ISSI flash parts.
*		     Added FlashQuadEnable API to enable quad mode in flash.
*		     Added FlashReadID API to read and identify the flash.
