*
*
* This file contains a design example using the QSPI driver (XQspiPs) in
* polled mode with a serial FLASH device. This examples performs
* some transfers in Auto mode and Manual start mode, to illustrate the modes
* available. It is recommended to use Manual CS + Auto start for
* best performance.
* The hardware which this example runs on. must have a serial FLASH (Numonyx
* N25Q, Winbond W25Q, Spansion S25FL, ISSI IS25WP) for it to run. This example
* has been tested with the Numonyx Serial Flash (N25Q128) and IS25WP series
* flash parts.
*
* @note

* None.
*
* <pre>
* MODIFICATION HISTORY:
*
* Ver   Who Date     Changes
* ----- --- -------- -----------------------------------------------
* 1.00  sdm 11/25/10 First release
* 1.01  srt 06/12/12 Changed to meet frequency requirements of READ command
*                    for CR 663787
* 2.00a	kka 22/08/12 Updated the example as XQspiPs_PolledTransfer API has
*		     changed. Changed the prescalar to use divide by 8.
*		     The user can change the prescalar to a maximum of
*		     divide by 2 based on the reference clock in the
*		     system.
* 	 	     Set the Holdb_dr bit in the configuration register using
*		     XQSPIPS_HOLD_B_DRIVE_OPTION. Setting this bit
*		     drives the HOLD bit of the QSPI controller.
*		     This is required for QSPI to be used in Non QSPI boot
*		     mode else there needs to be an external pullup on this
*		     line.
*		     See http://www.xilinx.com/support/answers/47596.htm.
* 2.01a sg  02/03/13 Created a function FlashReadID. Removed multiple
*		     initialization using SetOptions.
*       ms  04/05/17 Modified Comment lines in functions to
*                    recognize it as documentation block for doxygen
*                    generation.
* 3.5	tjs 07/16/18 Added support for low density ISSI flash parts.
*		     Added FlashQuadEnable API to enable quad mode in flash.
* 3.6   akm 04/15/19 Modified FlashQuadEnable, FlashWrie and FlashErase APIs,
*                    to wait for the on going operation to complete before
*                    performing the next operation.
