#  7.0   adk    01/07/14    FirstRelease
#  7.1   ms     01/16/17    Updated the parameter naming from
#                           XPAR_CFA_NUM_INSTANCES to XPAR_XCFA_NUM_INSTANCES
#                           to avoid  compilation failure for
#                           XPAR_CFA_NUM_INSTANCES as the tools are generating
#                           XPAR_XCFA_NUM_INSTANCES in the generated xcfa_g.c
#                           for fixing MISRA-C files. This is a fix for
#                           CR-966099 based on the update in the tools.
