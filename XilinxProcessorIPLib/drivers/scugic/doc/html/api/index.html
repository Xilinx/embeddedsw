<div class="textblock"><p>The generic interrupt controller driver component.The interrupt controller driver uses the idea of priority for the various handlers. Priority is an integer within the range of 1 and 31 inclusive with default of 1 being the highest priority interrupt source. The priorities of the various sources can be dynamically altered as needed through hardware configuration.</p>
<p>The generic interrupt controller supports the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>specific individual interrupt enabling/disabling</li>
<li>specific individual interrupt acknowledging</li>
<li>attaching specific callback function to handle interrupt source</li>
<li>assigning desired priority to interrupt source if default is not acceptable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Details about connecting the interrupt handler of the driver are contained in the source file specific to interrupt processing, <a class="el" href="xscugic__intr_8c.html">xscugic_intr.c</a>.</p>
<p>This driver is intended to be RTOS and processor independent. It works with physical addresses only. Any needs for dynamic memory management, threads or thread mutual exclusion, virtual memory, or cache control must be satisfied by the layer above this driver.</p>
<p><b>Interrupt Vector Tables</b></p>
<p>The device ID of the interrupt controller device is used by the driver as a direct index into the configuration data table. The user should populate the vector table with handlers and callbacks at run-time using the <a class="el" href="group__scugic__v3__8.html#ga48f9dd531aa861a74e6bd627943573ea" title="Makes the connection between the Int_Id of the interrupt source and the associated handler that is to...">XScuGic_Connect()</a> and <a class="el" href="group__scugic__v3__8.html#gad162acedbbd41fd890fc7f2225ed480b" title="Updates the interrupt table with the Null Handler and NULL arguments at the location pointed at by th...">XScuGic_Disconnect()</a> functions.</p>
<p>Each vector table entry corresponds to a device that can generate an interrupt. Each entry contains an interrupt handler function and an argument to be passed to the handler when an interrupt occurs. The user must use <a class="el" href="group__scugic__v3__8.html#ga48f9dd531aa861a74e6bd627943573ea" title="Makes the connection between the Int_Id of the interrupt source and the associated handler that is to...">XScuGic_Connect()</a> when the interrupt handler takes an argument other than the base address.</p>
<p><b>Nested Interrupts Processing</b></p>
<p>Nested interrupts are not supported by this driver.</p>
<p>NOTE: The generic interrupt controller is not a part of the snoop control unit as indicated by the prefix "scu" in the name of the driver. It is an independent module in APU.</p>

1.00a drg  01/19/00 First release
1.01a sdm  11/09/11 The <a class="el" href="struct_x_scu_gic.html" title="The XScuGic driver instance data. ">XScuGic</a> and <a class="el" href="struct_x_scu_gic___config.html" title="This typedef contains configuration information for the device. ">XScuGic_Config</a> structures have changed.
              The HandlerTable (of type XScuGic_VectorTableEntry) is
              moved to <a class="el" href="struct_x_scu_gic___config.html" title="This typedef contains configuration information for the device. ">XScuGic_Config</a> structure from <a class="el" href="struct_x_scu_gic.html" title="The XScuGic driver instance data. ">XScuGic</a> structure.</pre><pre>              The "Config" entry in <a class="el" href="struct_x_scu_gic.html" title="The XScuGic driver instance data. ">XScuGic</a> structure is made as
              pointer for better efficiency.</pre><pre>              A new file named as <a class="el" href="xscugic__hw_8c.html">xscugic_hw.c</a> is now added. It is
              to implement low level driver routines without using
              any xscugic instance pointer. They are useful when the
              user wants to use xscugic through device id or
              base address. The driver routines provided are explained
              below.
              XScuGic_DeviceInitialize that takes device id as
              argument and initializes the device (without calling
              XScuGic_CfgInitialize).
              XScuGic_DeviceInterruptHandler that takes device id
              as argument and calls appropriate handlers from the
              HandlerTable.
              XScuGic_RegisterHandler that registers a new handler
              by taking xscugic hardware base address as argument.
              LookupConfigByBaseAddress is used to return the
              corresponding config structure from XScuGic_ConfigTable
              based on the scugic base address passed.
1.02a sdm  12/20/11 Removed AckBeforeService from the <a class="el" href="struct_x_scu_gic___config.html" title="This typedef contains configuration information for the device. ">XScuGic_Config</a>
              structure.
1.03a srt  02/27/13 Moved Offset calculation macros from *.c and *_hw.c to
              *_hw.h
              Added APIs<ul>
<li><a class="el" href="group__scugic__v3__8.html#gaf58a00ee3c052d8aec17b179c86388c7" title="Sets the interrupt priority and trigger type for the specificd IRQ source. ">XScuGic_SetPriTrigTypeByDistAddr()</a></li>
<li><a class="el" href="group__scugic__v3__8.html#ga0c6a61acf2d5d030542c788a9aa42004" title="Gets the interrupt priority and trigger type for the specificd IRQ source. ">XScuGic_GetPriTrigTypeByDistAddr()</a>
              (CR 702687)
                Added support to direct interrupts to the appropriate CPU. Earlier
                  interrupts were directed to CPU1 (hard coded). Now depending
                  upon the CPU selected by the user (xparameters.h), interrupts
                  will be directed to the relevant CPU. This fixes CR 699688.
1.04a hk   05/04/13 Assigned EffectiveAddr to CpuBaseAddress in
                  XScuGic_CfgInitialize. Fix for CR#704400 to remove warnings.
                  Moved functions XScuGic_SetPriTrigTypeByDistAddr and
            XScuGic_GetPriTrigTypeByDistAddr to <a class="el" href="xscugic__hw_8c.html">xscugic_hw.c</a>.
                  This is fix for CR#705621.
1.05a hk   06/26/13 Modified tcl to export external interrupts correctly to
                    xparameters.h. Fix for CR's 690505, 708928 &amp; 719359.
2.0   adk  12/10/13 Updated as per the New Tcl API's
2.1   adk  25/04/14 Fixed the CR:789373 changes are made in the driver tcl file.
3.00  kvn  02/13/15 Modified code for MISRA-C:2012 compliance.
3.2   asa  02/29/16 Modified DistributorInit function for Zynq AMP case. The
                  distributor is left uninitialized for Zynq AMP. It is assumed
            that the distributor will be initialized by Linux master. However
            for CortexR5 case, the earlier code is left unchanged where the
            the interrupt processor target registers in the distributor is
            initialized with the corresponding CPU ID on which the application
            built over the scugic driver runs.
            These changes fix CR#937243.</li>
</ul>
</pre><pre>3.4   asa  04/07/16 Created a new static function DoDistributorInit to simplify
           the flow and avoid code duplication. Changes are made for
           USE_AMP use case for R5. In a scenario (in R5 split mode) when
           one R5 is operating with A53 in open amp config and other
           R5 running baremetal app, the existing code
           had the potential to stop the whole AMP solution to work (if
           for some reason the R5 running the baremetal app tasked to
           initialize the Distributor hangs or crashes before initializing).
           Changes are made so that the R5 under AMP first checks if
           the distributor is enabled or not and if not, it does the
           standard Distributor initialization.
           This fixes the CR#952962.
3.6   ms   01/23/17 Modified xil_printf statement in main function for all
                    examples to ensure that "Successfully ran" and "Failed"
                    strings are available in all examples. This is a fix
                    for CR-965028.
      kvn  02/17/17 Add support for changing GIC CPU master at run time.
      kvn  02/28/17 Make the CpuId as static variable and Added new
                    XScugiC_GetCpuId to access CpuId.
      ms   03/17/17 Added readme.txt file in examples folder for doxygen
                    generation.
3.7   ms   04/11/17 Modified tcl file to add suffix U for all macro
                    definitions of scugic in xparameters.h
3.8   mus  07/05/17 Updated scugic.tcl to add support for intrrupts connected
                    through util_reduced_vector IP(OR gate)
      mus  07/05/17 Updated xdefine_zynq_canonical_xpars proc to initialize
                    the HandlerTable in XScuGic_ConfigTable to 0, it removes
                    the compilation warning in <a class="el" href="xscugic__g_8c.html">xscugic_g.c</a>. Fix for CR#978736.
      mus  07/25/17 Updated xdefine_gic_params proc to export correct canonical
                    definitions for pl to ps interrupts.Fix for CR#980534</pre><pre></pre> </div></div><!-- contents -->
