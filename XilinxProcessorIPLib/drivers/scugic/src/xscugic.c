* <pre>
* MODIFICATION HISTORY:
*
* Ver   Who  Date     Changes
* ----- ---- -------- --------------------------------------------------------
* 1.00a drg  01/19/10 First release
* 1.01a sdm  11/09/11 Changes are made in function XScuGic_CfgInitialize
*                     Since entry is now made as pointer in the XScuGic
*                     structure, necessary changes are made.
*                     The HandlerTable can now be populated through the low
*                     level routine XScuGic_RegisterHandler added in this
*                     release. Hence necessary checks are added not to
*                     overwrite the HandlerTable entries in function
*                     XScuGic_CfgInitialize.
* 1.03a srt  02/27/13 Added APIs
*                       -XScuGic_SetPriTrigTypeByDistAddr()
*                       -XScuGic_GetPriTrigTypeByDistAddr()
*                     Removed Offset calculation macros, defined in _hw.h
*                     (CR 702687)
*                     added support to direct interrupts  to the appropriate
*                     CPU Earlier interrupts were directed to CPU1
*                     (hard coded).Now depending upon the CPU selected by the
*                     user(xparameters.h), interrupts will be directed to
*                     the  relevant CPU. This fixes CR 699688.
*
* 1.04a hk   05/04/13 Assigned EffectiveAddr to CpuBaseAddress in
*                     XScuGic_CfgInitialize. Fix for CR#704400 to remove
*                     warnings.
*                     Moved functions XScuGic_SetPriTrigTypeByDistAddr and
*                    XScuGic_GetPriTrigTypeByDistAddr to xscugic_hw.c.
*                    This is fix for CR#705621.
* 1.06a asa  16/11/13 Fix for CR#749178. Assignment for EffectiveAddr
*                     in function XScuGic_CfgInitialize is removed as it was
*                     a bug.
* 3.00  kvn  02/13/14 Modified code for MISRA-C:2012 compliance.
* 3.01  pkp  06/19/15 Added XScuGic_InterruptMaptoCpu API for an interrupt
*                     target CPU mapping
* 3.02  pkp  11/09/15 Modified DistributorInit function for AMP case to add
*                     the current cpu to interrupt processor targets registers
* 3.2   asa  02/29/16 Modified DistributorInit function for Zynq AMP case. The
*                     distributor is left uninitialized for Zynq AMP. It is
*                     assumed that the distributor will be initialized by
*                     Linux master. However for CortexR5 case, the earlier code
*                     is left unchanged where the interrupt processor target
*                     registers in the distributor is initialized with the
*                     corresponding CPU ID on which the application built over
*                     the scugic driver runs. These changes fix CR#937243.
* 3.3   pkp  05/12/16 Modified XScuGic_InterruptMaptoCpu to write proper value
*                     to interrupt target register to fix CR#951848
*
* 3.4   asa  04/07/16 Created a new static function DoDistributorInit to
*                     simplify the flow and avoid code duplication. Changes are
*                     made for USE_AMP use case for R5. In a scenario
*                     (in R5 split mode) when one R5 is operating with A53 in
*                     open amp config and other R5 running baremetal app, the
*                     existing code had the potential to stop the whole AMP
*                     solution to work (if for some reason the R5 running the
*                     baremetal app tasked to initialize the Distributor hangs
*                     or crashes before initializing).Changes are made so that
*                     the R5 under AMP first checks if the distributor is
*                     enabled or not and if not, it does the standard
*                     Distributor initialization.This fixes the CR#952962.
* 3.4   mus  09/08/16 Added assert to avoid invalid access of GIC from CPUID 1
*                     for single core zynq-7000s
* 3.5   mus  10/05/16 Modified DistributorInit function to avoid
*                     re-initialization of distributor, If it is already
*                     initialized by other CPU.
* 3.5   pkp  10/17/16 Modified XScuGic_InterruptMaptoCpu to correct the CPU Id
*                     value and properly mask interrupt target processor value
*                     to modify interrupt target processor register for a given
*                     interrupt ID and cpu ID
* 3.6   pkp  20/01/17 Added new API XScuGic_Stop to Disable distributor and
*                     interrupts in case they are being used only by current
*                     cpu. It also removes current cpu from interrupt target
*                     registers for all interrupts.
*       kvn  02/17/17 Add support for changing GIC CPU master at run time.
*       kvn  02/28/17 Make the CpuId as static variable and Added new
*                     XScugiC_GetCpuId to access CpuId.
* 3.9   mus  02/21/18 Added new API's XScuGic_UnmapAllInterruptsFromCpu and
*                     XScuGic_InterruptUnmapFromCpu, These API's can be used
*                     by applications to unmap specific/all interrupts from
*                     target CPU. It fixes CR#992490.
* 3.10  mus  07/17/18 Updated file to fix the various coding style issues
*                     reported by checkpatch. It fixes CR#1006344.
* 3.10  aru  08/23/18 Resolved MISRA-C:2012 compliance mandatory violations
*                     It fixes CR#1007753.
* 3.10  mus  09/19/18 Fix cppcheck warnings
* 4.0   mus  11/22/18 Fixed bugs in software interrupt generation through
*                     XScuGic_SoftwareIntr API
* 4.1   asa  03/30/19 Made changes not to direct each interrupt to all
*                     available CPUs by default. This was breaking AMP
*                     behavior. Instead every time an interrupt enable
*                     request is received, the interrupt was mapped to
*                     the respective CPU. There were several other changes
*                     made to implement this. This set of changes was to
*                     fix CR-1024716.
* 4.1   mus  06/19/19 Added API's XScuGic_MarkCoreAsleep and
*                     XScuGic_MarkCoreAwake to mark processor core as
*                     asleep or awake. Fix for CR#1027220.
* 4.3   mus  10/14/20 Updated XScuGic_Stop for scenarios where USE_AMP flag
*                     is set to 1. Now, XScuGic_Stop would not disable
*                     distributor for USE_AMP=1, even when SPI interrupts
*                     are not being used by other CPU. This update is needed
*                     to support scenarios, where master CPU is using only
*                     SGI/PPI interrupts. It fixes CR#1079241.
* 4.5   asa  03/07/21 Added spinlock protection for critical sections in the
*                     code. The sections are critical when applications
*                     running on separate CPUs (R5s or A9s) try to update
*                     the same register. The spinlock mechanism used here
*                     used exclusive load and store instructions. To ensure
*                     that legacy behavior is not broken, unless someone
*                     enables spinlocks explicitely in their applications
*                     the existing flow will remain unchanged. On how to
*                     enable spinlocks, please refer to the documentations
*                     at: lib/bsp/standalone/src/arm/common/gcc/xil_spinlock.c
* 4.6	sk   08/05/21 Fix scugic Misra-c violations.
* 4.7	sk   09/14/21 Fix gcc compiler warnings for A72 processor.
* 4.7	sk   10/13/21 Update APIs to perform interrupt mapping/unmapping only
* 		      when (Int_Id >= XSCUGIC_SPI_INT_ID_START).
* 4.7   dp   11/22/21 Added new API XScuGic_IsInitialized() to check and return
*                     the GIC initialization status.
* 4.7   mus  03/17/22 Fixed XScuGic_InterruptMaptoCpu and
*                     XScuGic_InterruptUnmapFromCpu for GICv3. It fixes
*                     CR#1126156.
* 5.0   mus  22/02/22 Added support for VERSAL NET.
* 5.0   asa  03/29/22 The API XScuGic_IsInitialized has a bug where if
* 		      Distributor Control Register, GICD_CTLR has both
* 		      bit 0 and 1 set, the API wrongly returns 0.
*                     This is fixed with this change.
* 5.0   dp   04/25/22 Update XScuGic_GetPriorityTriggerType() to read and
*                     update priority and trigger properly for GICv3.
* 5.1   mus  02/09/23 Updated DoDistributorInit function to skip enablement
*                     of group0 interrupts when processor is running at
*                     EL1 NS. This is required to avoid abort, since access
*                     to ICC_IGRPEN0_EL1 is resulting into sync abort.
*                     It fixes CR#1152445.
* 5.1   mus  02/13/23 Updated XScuGic_CfgInitialize, XScuGic_Enable and
*                     XScuGic_Disable to support interrupts on each core
*                     of all CortexA78/CortexR52 clusters in VERSAL NET SoC.
*                     While at it, modified interrupt routing logic to make
*                     use of CPU affinity register instead of XPAR_CPU_ID macro.
*                     Also, XScuGic_CfgInitialize has been updated to find
*                     redistributor base address of core on which API is
*                     executed, redistributor address will be stored in newly
*                     added member of XScuGic data structure "RedistBaseAddr".
*                     It fixes CR#1150432.
* 5.1   mus  02/27/23 Updated XScuGic_Stop for GICv3, to check routing register for
*                     detecting targeted cores for specific interrupt id.
*                     Also, DoDistributorInit has been modified to move CPU
*                     interface specific register writes to XScuGic_CfgInitialize.
