*
* The Xilinx mailbox driver. This driver supports the Xilinx
* Mailbox device. More detailed description of the driver operation can
* be found in the xmbox.c file.
*
* - The Xilinx Mailbox is intended to be used as a bi-directional communication
*   core between a pair of processors. The mailbox API shall allow software
*   to send messages in a FIFO fashion, where the receiver is intended to be
*   software on another processor.
* - The mailbox implementation provides for a way to "send" and "receive" in
*   an atomic fashion using seperate FIFOs in the mailbox core.
* - The API itself does not stop the use case where there is more than one
*   sender on the transmit side and more than one receiver on the receiving side
*   (just like TCP/IP sockets). However, unless there is a protocol implemented
*   in the messages being transferred, it is typically good practice to assign
*   just one transmit processor and one receiver processor to a single mailbox.
* - The API provides for both blocking and non-blocking semantics on the send
*   and receive operations.
*
* <b>Initialization & Configuration</b>
*
* The XMbox_Config structure is used by the driver to configure itself. This
* configuration structure is typically created by the tool-chain based on HW
* build properties.
*
*   - XMbox_LookupConfig(DeviceId) - Use the device identifier to find the
*     static configuration structure defined in XMbox_g.c. This is setup by
*     the tools. For some operating systems the config structure will be
*     initialized by the software and this call is not needed. This function
*     returns the CfgPtr argument used by the CfgInitialize function described
*     below.
*
*   - XMbox_CfgInitialize(InstancePtr, CfgPtr, EffectiveAddress) - Uses a
*     configuration structure provided by the caller. If running in a system
*     with address translation, the provided virtual memory base address
*     replaces the physical address present in the configuration structure.
*     The EffectiveAddress argument is required regardless of operating system
*     environment, i.e. in standalone, CfgPtr->BaseAddress is recommended, not
*     the xparameters.h #define.
*
*
* <b>Interrupts</b>
*
* The Mailbox hardware has two interrupt outputs, one for each interface.
*
* For an interface that uses Direct FSL the associated interrupt pin shall be
* high while there is data in the FIFO for this interface.
*
* For a PLB interface there shall be 3 associated interrupt sources that can be
* controlled through dedicated registers. Each of these sources shall be
* associated with a specific bit position in the related register. The sources
* shall be: Send Threshold Interrupt (STI), Receive Threshold Interrupt (RTI)
* and FIFO Error (ERR). RTI is set when the number of entries in the receive
* FIFO become greater than the RIT value (rising edge on RTA). STI is set when
* the number of entries in the send FIFO becomes equal or less than the SIT
* value (rising edge on STA). RTI and STI are only set when their respective
* conditions goes from false to true, not continuously when the condition is
* fulfilled.
*
* The Mailbox driver does not have an interrupt service routine. It is the
* responsibility of the caller of Mailbox functions to manage the interrupt
* including connecting to the interrupt and enabling/disabling the interrupt.
* The user can create a handler to service the interrupts generated by the
* Mailbox IP.
*
* Using the Blocking version of the Read function is not recommended since
* the processor will hang until the requested length is received, which might
* be quite a long time.
*
* @note
*
* This driver is intended to be RTOS and processor independent. It works with
* physical addresses only. Any needs for dynamic memory management, threads
* or thread mutual exclusion, virtual memory, or cache control must be
* satisfied by the layer above this driver.
*
* Possible Optimization technique:
* If the interface for the hardware is only expected to be the memory mapped
* or the FSL interface for the lifetime of the project, it is reasonable to
* remove the other, unused, leg through the functions which allow access to
* the other interface method, i.e. if FSL is the only available interface the
* memory mapped clause in the if statements can be removed improving the
* performance some due to the lack of the test and branch.

*                     examples to ensure that "Successfully ran" and "Failed"
*                     strings are available in all examples. This is a fix
*                     for CR-965028.
