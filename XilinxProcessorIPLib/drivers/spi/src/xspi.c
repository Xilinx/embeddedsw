* MODIFICATION HISTORY:
*
* Ver   Who  Date     Changes
* ----- ---- -------- -----------------------------------------------
* 1.00a rpm  10/11/01 First release
* 1.00b jhl  03/14/02 Repartitioned driver for smaller files.
* 1.00b rpm  04/25/02 Collapsed IPIF and reg base addresses into one
* 1.00b rmm  05/14/03 Fixed diab compiler warnings relating to asserts
* 1.01a jvb  12/13/05 Changed Initialize() into CfgInitialize(), and made
*                     CfgInitialize() take a pointer to a config structure
*                     instead of a device id. Moved Initialize() into
*                     xspi_sinit.c, and had Initialize() call CfgInitialize()
*                     after it retrieved the config structure using the device
*                     id. Removed include of xparameters.h along with any
*                     dependencies on xparameters.h and the _g.c config table.
* 1.11a wgr  03/22/07 Converted to new coding style.
* 1.11a rpm  01/22/08 Updated comment on Transfer regarding needing interrupts.
* 1.12a sdm  03/27/08 Updated the code to support 16/32 bit transfer width and
*                     polled mode of operation. Even for the polled mode of
*                     operation the Interrupt Logic in the core should be
*                     included. The driver can be put in polled mode of
*                     operation by disabling the Global Interrupt after the
*                     Spi Initialization is completed.
* 2.00a sdm  07/30/08 Updated the code to support 16/32 bit transfer width and
*                     polled mode of operation. Even for the polled mode of
*                     operation the Interrupt Logic in the core should be
*                     included. The driver can be put in polled mode of
*                     operation by disabling the Global Interrupt after the
*                     Spi Initialization is completed.
* 2.01b sdm  04/08/09 Fixed an issue in the XSpi_Transfer function where the
*                     Global Interrupt is being enabled in polled mode when a
*                     slave is not selected.
* 3.00a ktn  10/28/09 Updated all the register accesses as 32 bit access.
*		      Updated to use the HAL APIs/macros.
*		      Removed the macro XSpi_mReset, XSpi_Reset API should be
*		      used in its place.
*		      The macros have been renamed to remove _m from the name.
*		      Removed an unnecessary read to the core register in the
*		      XSpi_GetSlaveSelect API.
* 3.01a sdm  04/23/10 Updated the driver to handle new slave mode interrupts
*		      and the DTR Half Empty interrupt.
* 3.04a bss  03/21/12 Updated XSpi_CfgInitialize to support XIP Mode
* 3.05a adk  18/04/13 Updated the code to avoid unused variable 
*	              warnings when compiling with the -Wextra -Wall flags
*		      In the file xspi.c. CR:705005.
* 3.06a adk  07/08/13 Added a dummy read in the CfgInitialize(), if startup
*		      block is used in the h/w design (CR 721229).
* 3.07a adk 11/10/13  In the xspi_transfer function moved the assert slave chip
* 		      select after the configuration of the Data Transmit 
*		      register inorder to work with CPOL and CPHA High Options.
* 		      As per spec (Dual/Quad SPI Transaction instrunction 7,8,9)
* 		      CR:732962
* 4.1	bss 08/07/14  Modified XSpi_Transfer to check for Interrupt Status
*		      register Tx Empty bit instead of Status register
*		      CR#810294.
* 4.2   sk   11/10/15 Used UINTPTR instead of u32 for Baseaddress CR# 867425.
*                     Changed the prototype of XSpi_CfgInitialize API.
* 4.4	tjs  11/28/17 When receive fifo exists, we need to check for status
*                     register rx fifo empty flag. If clear we can proceed for
*                     read. Otherwise we will hit exception. CR# 989938
* 4.5	akm  05/29/19 Removed master inhibit dependency while writing DTR
*		      in between multiple transfers.
* 4.7	akm  10/22/20 Removed dependency of Tx_Full flag while writing DTR
*		      in between multiple transfers.

/**
*
* Transfers the specified data on the SPI bus. If the SPI device is configured
* to be a master, this function initiates bus communication and sends/receives
* the data to/from the selected SPI slave. If the SPI device is configured to
* be a slave, this function prepares the data to be sent/received when selected
* by a master. For every byte sent, a byte is received.
*
* This function/driver operates in interrupt mode and polled mode.
*  - In interrupt mode this function is non-blocking and the transfer is
*    initiated by this function and completed by the interrupt service routine.
*  - In polled mode this function is blocking and the control exits this
*    function only after all the requested data is transferred.
*
* The caller has the option of providing two different buffers for send and
* receive, or one buffer for both send and receive, or no buffer for receive.
* The receive buffer must be at least as big as the send buffer to prevent
* unwanted memory writes. This implies that the byte count passed in as an
* argument must be the smaller of the two buffers if they differ in size.
* Here are some sample usages:
* <pre>
*	XSpi_Transfer(InstancePtr, SendBuf, RecvBuf, ByteCount)
*	The caller wishes to send and receive, and provides two different
*	buffers for send and receive.
*
*	XSpi_Transfer(InstancePtr, SendBuf, NULL, ByteCount)
*	The caller wishes only to send and does not care about the received
*	data. The driver ignores the received data in this case.
*
*	XSpi_Transfer(InstancePtr, SendBuf, SendBuf, ByteCount)
*	The caller wishes to send and receive, but provides the same buffer
*	for doing both. The driver sends the data and overwrites the send
*	buffer with received data as it transfers the data.
*
*	XSpi_Transfer(InstancePtr, RecvBuf, RecvBuf, ByteCount)
*	The caller wishes to only receive and does not care about sending
*	data.  In this case, the caller must still provide a send buffer, but
*	it can be the same as the receive buffer if the caller does not care
*	what it sends. The device must send N bytes of data if it wishes to
*	receive N bytes of data.
* </pre>
* In interrupt mode, though this function takes a buffer as an argument, the
* driver can only transfer a limited number of bytes at time. It transfers only
* one byte at a time if there are no FIFOs, or it can transfer the number of
* bytes up to the size of the FIFO if FIFOs exist.
*  - In interrupt mode a call to this function only starts the transfer, the
*    subsequent transfer of the data is performed by the interrupt service
*    routine until the entire buffer has been transferred.The status callback
*    function is called when the entire buffer has been sent/received.
*  - In polled mode this function is blocking and the control exits this
*    function only after all the requested data is transferred.
*
* As a master, the SetSlaveSelect function must be called prior to this
* function.
*
* @param	InstancePtr is a pointer to the XSpi instance to be worked on.
* @param	SendBufPtr is a pointer to a buffer of data which is to be sent.
*		This buffer must not be NULL.
* @param	RecvBufPtr is a pointer to a buffer which will be filled with
*		received data. This argument can be NULL if the caller does not
*		wish to receive data.
* @param	ByteCount contains the number of bytes to send/receive. The
*		number of bytes received always equals the number of bytes sent.
*
* @return
*		-XST_SUCCESS if the buffers are successfully handed off to the
*		driver for transfer. Otherwise, returns:
*		- XST_DEVICE_IS_STOPPED if the device must be started before
*		transferring data.
*		- XST_DEVICE_BUSY indicates that a data transfer is already in
*		progress. This is determined by the driver.
*		- XST_SPI_NO_SLAVE indicates the device is configured as a
*		master and a slave has not yet been selected.
*
* @notes
*
* This function is not thread-safe.  The higher layer software must ensure that
* no two threads are transferring data on the SPI bus at the same time.

* - Data Transmit Register (FIFO) Empty. This interrupt is generated when the
*   transmit register or FIFO is empty. The driver uses this interrupt during a
*   transmission to continually send/receive data until there is no more data
*   to send/receive.
*
* - Data Transmit Register (FIFO) Underrun. This interrupt is generated when
*   the SPI device, when configured as a slave, attempts to read an empty
*   DTR/FIFO.  An empty DTR/FIFO usually means that software is not giving the
*   device data in a timely manner. No action is taken by the driver other than
*   to inform the upper layer software of the error.
*
* - Data Receive Register (FIFO) Overrun. This interrupt is generated when the
*   SPI device attempts to write a received byte to an already full DRR/FIFO.
*   A full DRR/FIFO usually means software is not emptying the data in a timely
*   manner.  No action is taken by the driver other than to inform the upper
*   layer software of the error.
*
* - Slave Mode Fault Error. This interrupt is generated if a slave device is
*   selected as a slave while it is disabled. No action is taken by the driver
*   other than to inform the upper layer software of the error.
*
* - Command Error. This interrupt occurs when the first byte in the Tx FIFO,
*   after the CS is asserted, doesn't match any command in the Lookup table.
*   This interrupt is valid only for axi_qspi.
*
* @param	InstancePtr is a pointer to the XSpi instance to be worked on.
