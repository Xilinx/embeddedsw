* hardware device with a serial EEPROM device.  The hardware which this
* example runs on must have a serial EEPROM (Microchip 25XX320 or 25XX160)

* platform for PPC processor.

* MODIFICATION HISTORY:
*
* Ver   Who  Date     Changes
* ----- ---- -------- -----------------------------------------------
* 1.00b jhl  02/27/01 First release
* 1.00c jhl  08/15/03 Fixed bugs (local instances and large buffers are now
*                                 moved to globals)
* 1.11a sv   9/10/07  Minor changes to comply to Doxygen and coding guidelines
* 3.00a ktn  10/28/09 Converted all register accesses to 32 bit access.
*		      Updated to use the HAL APIs/macros. Replaced call to
*		      XSpi_Initialize API with XSpi_LookupConfig and
*		      XSpi_CfgInitialize.
* 4.2   ms   01/23/17 Added xil_printf statement in main function to
*                     ensure that "Successfully ran" and "Failed" strings
*                     are available in all examples. This is a fix for
*                     CR-965028.
*       ms   04/05/17 Modified Comment lines to follow doxygen rules.
