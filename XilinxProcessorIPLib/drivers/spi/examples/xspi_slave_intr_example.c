* @file xspi_slave_intr_example.c
*
*
* This file contains a design example using the Spi driver (XSpi) and the Spi
* device as a Slave, in interrupt mode.
*
* This example fills the Spi Tx buffer with the number of data bytes it expects
* to receive from the master and then Spi device waits for an external master to
* initiate the transfer. When the master initiates the transfer, the Spi device
* receives data from the master and simultaneously sends the data in Tx buffer
* to the master. Once the transfer is complete, a transfer complete interrupt is
* generated and this example prints the data received from the master. The
* number of bytes to be received by the Spi slave is defined by the constant
* BUFFER_SIZE in this file.
*
* The external SPI devices that are present on the Xilinx boards don't support
* the Master functionality. This example has been tested with Aardvark I2C/SPI
* Host Adapter, an off board external SPI Master device and the Xilinx SPI
* device configured as a Slave. This example has been tested for byte-wide SPI
* transfers.
*
* @note
*
* This example assumes that there is a STDIO device in the system.
*
*<pre>
* MODIFICATION HISTORY:
*
* Ver   Who  Date     Changes
* ----- ---- -------- ---------------------------------------------------------
* 1.00a psk  09/05/08 First Release
* 3.00a ktn  10/22/09 Converted all register accesses to 32 bit access.
*		      Updated to use the HAL APIs/macros. Replaced call to
*		      XSpi_Initialize API with XSpi_LookupConfig and
*		      XSpi_CfgInitialize.
* 3.01a sdm  04/23/10 Enabled DTR Half_empty interrupt so that Tx FIFO is
*		      not empty during a transfer in slave mode.
* 4.2   ms   01/23/17 Added xil_printf statement in main function to
*                     ensure that "Successfully ran" and "Failed" strings
*                     are available in all examples. This is a fix for
*                     CR-965028.
