* @file xspi_atmel_flash_example.c
*
* This file contains a design example using the SPI driver (XSpi) and
* hardware device with an Atmel Serial Flash Device (AT45XX series).
* This example erases the Page, writes to the Page, reads back from the Page and
* compares the data.
*
* This example works for an Atmel AT45DB161D. The bytes per page
* (ATMEL_PAGE_SIZE) in this device is 528 bytes for default addressing mode and
* 512 bytes in Power-of-2 addressing mode.
* For further details of device refer to the Atmel Datasheet of AT45DB161D
* device.
*
* The ATMEL_PAGE_SIZE constant need to be updated by the user according to the
* Device used.
*
* The ATMEL_FLASH_TEST_ADDRESS constant need to be updated by the user according
* to the serial flash device used, there is no error checking done in the
* example for the address specified by the user.
*
* This example also works with the In-System Flash(ISF) in the S3AN devices.
* The ATMEL_PAGE_SIZE and ATMEL_FLASH_TEST_ADDRESS need to be defined properly
* based on the device used. For further details of the ISF refer to the
* Spartan-3AN FPGA In-System Flash User Guide (UG333).
*
* This example assumes that the underlying processor is MicroBlaze and default
* addressing mode is used in the Flash Device.
*
* @note
*
* None.

* <pre>
* MODIFICATION HISTORY:
*
* Ver   Who  Date     Changes
* ----- ---- -------- -----------------------------------------------
* 1.00a sdn  02/26/08 First release
* 1.00a sdn  07/02/08 Changed the initialization so that the SPI
*		      Master works in Spi Mode 3 as the In-System Flash
*		      works only in Spi Mode 3
* 3.00a ktn  10/22/09 Converted all register accesses to 32 bit access.
*		      Updated to use the HAL APIs/macros. Replaced call to
*		      XSpi_Initialize API with XSpi_LookupConfig and
*		      XSpi_CfgInitialize.
* 4.2   ms   01/23/17 Added xil_printf statement in main function to
*                     ensure that "Successfully ran" and "Failed" strings
*                     are available in all examples. This is a fix for
*                     CR-965028.
*       ms   04/05/17 Modified Comment lines to follow doxygen rules.
