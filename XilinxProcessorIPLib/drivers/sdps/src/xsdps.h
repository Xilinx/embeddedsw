*
* This file contains the implementation of XSdPs driver.
* This driver is used initialize read from and write to the SD card.
* Features such as switching bus width to 4-bit and switching to high speed,
* changing clock frequency, block size etc. are supported.
* SD 2.0 uses 1/4 bus width and speeds of 25/50KHz. Initialization, however
* is done using 1-bit bus width and 400KHz clock frequency.
* SD commands are classified as broadcast and addressed. Commands can be
* those with response only (using only command line) or
* response + data (using command and data lines).
* Only one command can be sent at a time. During a data transfer however,
* when dsta lines are in use, certain commands (which use only the command
* line) can be sent, most often to obtain status.
* This driver does not support multi card slots at present.
*
* Initialization:
* This includes initialization on the host controller side to select
* clock frequency, bus power and default transfer related parameters.
* The default voltage is 3.3V.
* On the SD card side, the initialization and identification state diagram is
* implemented. This resets the card, gives it a unique address/ID and
* identifies key card related specifications.
*
* Data transfer:
* The SD card is put in transfer state to read from or write to it.
* The default block size is 512 bytes and if supported,
* default bus width is 4-bit and bus speed is High speed.
* The read and write functions are implemented in polled mode using ADMA2.
*
* At any point, when key parameters such as block size or
* clock/speed or bus width are modified, this driver takes care of
* maintaining the same selection on host and card.
* All error bits in host controller are monitored by the driver and in the
* event one of them is set, driver will clear the interrupt status and
* communicate failure to the upper layer.
*
* File system use:
* This driver can be used with xilffs library to read and write files to SD.
* (Please refer to procedure in diskio.c). The file system read/write example
* in polled mode can used for reference.
*
* There is no example for using SD driver without file system at present.
* However, the driver can be used without the file system. The glue layer
* in filesystem can be used as reference for the same. The block count
* passed to the read/write function in one call is limited by the ADMA2
* descriptor table and hence care will have to be taken to call read/write
* API's in a loop for large file sizes.
*
* Interrupt mode is not supported because it offers no improvement when used
* with file system.
*
* eMMC support:
* SD driver supports SD and eMMC based on the "enable MMC" parameter in SDK.
* The features of eMMC supported by the driver will depend on those supported
* by the host controller. The current driver supports read/write on eMMC card
* using 4-bit and high speed mode currently.
*
* Features not supported include - card write protect, password setting,
* lock/unlock, interrupts, SDMA mode, programmed I/O mode and
* 64-bit addressed ADMA2, erase/pre-erase commands.
