/**

 * @file xdppsu_poll_example.c
 *
 * Contains a design example using the XDpPsu driver with polling. Once the
 * polling detects a Hot-Plug-Detect event (HPD - DisplayPort cable is plugged/
 * unplugged or the monitor is turned on/off), the main link will be trained.
 *
 * @note	For this example to display output, the user will need to
 *		implement initialization of the system (DpPsu_PlatformInit) and,
 *		after training is complete, implement configuration of the video
 *		stream source in order to provide the DisplayPort core with
 *		input (DpPsu_StreamSrc* - called in xdppsu_common_example.c).
 *
 * @note	The functions DpPsu_PlatformInit and DpPsu_StreamSrc* are declared
 *		extern in xdppsu_common_example.h and are left up to the user to
 *		implement.
