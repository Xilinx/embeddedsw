/**
* @file xgpio_low_level_example.c
*
* This file contains a design example using the General Purpose I/O (GPIO) low
* level driver and hardware device. It only uses a channel 1 of a GPIO device.
*
* <pre>
* MODIFICATION HISTORY:
*
* Ver   Who  Date	 Changes
* ----- ---- -------- -----------------------------------------------
* 1.00b jhl  04/29/02 First release
* 2.00a jhl  12/30/02 Addition of dual channel capability
* 2.00a sv   04/18/05 Minor changes to comply to Doxygen and coding guidelines
* 3.00a ktn  11/21/09 Removed the macros XGpio_mSetDataDirection,
*		      XGpio_mGetDataReg and XGpio_mSetDataReg. Users
*		      should use XGpio_WriteReg/XGpio_ReadReg to achieve the
*		      same functionality.
* 4.1   lks  11/18/15 Updated to use canonical xparameters and
*		      clean up of the comments and code for CR 900381
* 4.3   ms   01/23/17 Added xil_printf statement in main function to
*                     ensure that "Successfully ran" and "Failed" strings
*                     are available in all examples. This is a fix for
*                     CR-965028.
* </pre>
