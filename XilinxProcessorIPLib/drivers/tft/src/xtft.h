* @{
* @details
*
* This header file contains the definitions and declarations for the
* high level driver to access the Xilinx TFT Controller Device.
*
* The device has the capability of displaying data onto a 640*480 VGA TFT
* screen. It can take up to 256K colors. There is no interrupt mode.
*
* The functions XTft_Setpixel and XTft_Getpixel are provided in the driver
* to write to and read from the individual pixels, the color values.
*
* These are generally stored in the assigned 2MB Video Memory which is
* configurable.
*
* Video Memory stores each pixel value in 32bits. Out of this 2MB memory which
* can hold 1024 pixels per line and 512 lines per frame data, only 640 pixels
* per line and 480 lines per frame are used.
*
* Each base color Red, Green, Blue is encoded using 6 bits which sums up to
* 18bits which is stored in the Dual port BRAM.
*
*
* <b>Initialization & Configuration</b>
*
* The XTft_Config structure is used by the driver to configure itself. This
* configuration structure is typically created by the tool-chain based on HW
* build properties.
*
* To support multiple runtime loading and initialization strategies employed
* by various operating systems, the driver instance can be initialized as
* follows:
*
*   - XTft_CfgInitialize(InstancePtr, CfgPtr, BaseAddress) - Uses a
*	configuration structure provided by the caller. If running in a system
*	with address translation, the provided virtual memory base address
*	replaces the physical address present in the configuration structure.
*
* <b>Interrupts</b>
*
* The TFT device supports a single interrupt which is generated for a Vsync
* pulse.
*
* This driver does not provide a Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) for the device.
* It is the responsibility of the application to provide one if needed.
*
* <b>RTOS Independence</b>
*
* This driver is intended to be RTOS and processor independent. It works
* with physical addresses only. Any needs for dynamic memory management,
* threads or thread mutual exclusion, virtual memory, or cache control must
* be satisfied by the layer above this driver.
*

* MODIFICATION HISTORY:
*
* Ver    Who   Date      Changes
* -----  ----  --------  -----------------------------------------------
* 1.00a  sg    03/24/08  First release
* 2.00a	 ktn   07/06/09	 Added XTft_IntrEnable(), XTft_IntrDisable()and,
*			 XTft_GetVsyncStatus() functions to access newly added
*			 Interrupt Enable and Status Register.
* 3.00a  ktn   10/22/09  Updated driver to use the HAL APIs/macros.
*		         Removed the macros XTft_mSetPixel and XTft_mGetPixel.
* 3.00a  bss   01/16/12  Updated driver to remove warnings from asserts.
* 3.01a  sg    05/30/12  Corrected the brace error introduced in
*			 XTft_GetPixel while changing it from macro to
*			 function for CR 647750.
* 3.02a  bss   11/30/12  CR 690338 - Corrected the brace error introduced in
*			 XTft_GetPixel for CR 647750.
* 4.00a  bss   01/25/13	 Added support for AXI TFT controller, this driver
*			 can only be used for AXI TFT controller
* 	 		 XTft_WriteReg and XTft_ReadReg functions are updated
*			 Removed all functionality associated with DCR access
*			 PlbAccess and DcrBaseAddr are removed from the
*			 XTft_Config config structure
* 4.01a  bss   11/01/13	 Modified driver tcl to retrieve C_BASEADDR/C_HIGHADDR
*			 CR#757359.
* 5.0   adk  19/12/13 Updated as per the New Tcl API's
* 6.0    sd  19/08/15  Updated the BaseAddress and VideoMemBaseAddr
*		         variables in XTft_Config to be UINTPTR to support
*			 64 bit addresses. Added AddrWidth to the
*			 XTft_Config structure which reflects the value of
*			 C_M_AXI_ADDR_WIDTH.
*			 Updated to tcl add the C_M_AXI_ADDR_WIDTH  parameter.
*			 Added XTFT_AR_LSB_OFFSET and XTFT_AR_MSB_OFFSET
*			 definitions to the xtft_hw.h file, these offsets
*			 are valid only when the Address Width is greater
*			 than 32 bits.
*       ms   01/23/17 Added xil_printf statement in main function for all
*                     examples to ensure that "Successfully ran" and "Failed"
*                     strings are available in all examples. This is a fix
*                     for CR-965028.
*       ms   03/17/17 Added readme.txt file in examples folder for doxygen
*                     generation.
* 6.1   ms   04/18/17 Modified tcl file to add suffix U for all macros
*                     definitions of tft in xparameters.h
*</pre>
