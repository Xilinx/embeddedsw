1. INTRODUCTION
------------

This example application is built to demonstrate the functionality of Xilinx HDMI Transmitter and Receiver running on the same hardware.

For details, see xhdmi_example.c.


2. FEATURES
------------
* HDMI RX is to receive and lock to the incoming HDMI stream from the SOURCE.
* By default, HDMI TX is to transmit HDMI stream received from the SOURCE by the RX to the SINK.
* If Color Bar module is selected (via UART menu), a test pattern generator IP will generate video stream according to user selection (via UART), then HDMI TX will transmit HDMI stream to the downstream SINK.
* If the HDCP (1.4, 2.2 or both) is enabled by the hardware, the application will supports HDCP handling in both HDMI TX and RX.

For details, please refer to PG235, PG236 and PG230.
