/**
*
* @file xspips_slave_polled_example.c
*
*
* This file contains a design example using the SPI controller in slave mode.
* This examples performs transfers in polled mode and has been tested with
* Aardvark Analyzer as Master. This example echoes data which it receives
* from the master. The slave controller expects MAX_DATA bytes of data from
* the master to transmit onto the SPI bus which the slave will receive into
* its Rx buffer. It will poll until the Rx FIFO is filled with the Threshold
* limit of data which is set to MAX_DATA. On sending data, the master will
* receive dummy bytes in response. Master has to send MAX_DATA dummy bytes
* to read back the echoed data.
*
*
* @note
*
* The slave mode test needs an external master to send data to the Spi device.
* This example has been tested with Aardvark Analyzer as Master.
* The Clock Polarity and Phase should match between master and the slave.
