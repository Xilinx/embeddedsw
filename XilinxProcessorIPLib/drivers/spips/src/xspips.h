* @{
* @details
*
* This file contains the implementation of the XSpiPs driver. It works for
* both the master and slave mode. User documentation for the driver functions
* is contained in this file in the form of comment blocks at the front of each
* function.
*
* An SPI device connects to an SPI bus through a 4-wire serial interface.
* The SPI bus is a full-duplex, synchronous bus that facilitates communication
* between one master and one slave. The device is always full-duplex,
* which means that for every byte sent, one is received, and vice-versa.
* The master controls the clock, so it can regulate when it wants to
* send or receive data. The slave is under control of the master, it must
* respond quickly since it has no control of the clock and must send/receive
* data as fast or as slow as the master does.
*
* <b>Initialization & Configuration</b>
*
* The XSpiPs_Config structure is used by the driver to configure itself. This
* configuration structure is typically created by the tool-chain based on HW
* build properties.
*
* To support multiple runtime loading and initialization strategies employed by
* various operating systems, the driver instance can be initialized in the
* following way:
*	- XSpiPs_LookupConfig(DeviceId) - Use the devide identifier to find the
*	static configuration structure defined in xspips_g.c. This is setup by
*	the tools. For some operating systems the config structure will be
*	initialized by the software and this call is not needed.
*	- XSpiPs_CfgInitialize(InstancePtr, CfgPtr, EffectiveAddr) - Uses a
*	configuration structure provided by the caller. If running in a system
*	with address translation, the provided virtual memory base address
*	replaces the physical address present in the configuration structure.
*
* <b>Multiple Masters</b>
*
* More than one master can exist, but arbitration is the responsibility of
* the higher layer software. The device driver does not perform any type of
* arbitration.
*
* <b>Multiple Slaves</b>
*
* Contention between multiple masters is detected by the hardware, in which
* case a mode fault occurs on the device. The device is disabled immediately
* by hardware, and the current word transfer is stopped. The Aborted word
* transfer due to the mode fault is resumed once the devie is enabled again.
*
* <b>Modes of Operation</b>
*
* There are four modes to perform a data transfer and the selection of a mode
* is based on Chip Select(CS) and Start. These two options individually, can
* be controlled either by software(Manual) or hardware(Auto).
* - Auto CS: Chip select is automatically asserted as soon as the first word
*	     is written into the TXFIFO and deasserted when the TXFIFO becomes
*	     empty
* - Manual CS: Software must assert and deassert CS.
* - Auto Start: Data transmission starts as soon as there is data in the
*		TXFIFO and stalls when the TXFIFO is empty
* - Manual Start: Software must start data transmission at the beginning of
*		  the transaction or whenever the TXFIFO has become empty
*
* The preferred combination is Manual CS and Auto Start.
* In this combination, the software asserts CS before loading any data into
* TXFIFO. In Auto Start mode, whenever data is in TXFIFO, controller sends it
* out until TXFIFO becomes empty. The software reads the RXFIFO whenever the
* data is available. If no further data, software disables CS.
*
* Risks/challenges of other combinations:
* - Manual CS and Manual Start: Manual Start bit should be set after each
*   TXFIFO write otherwise there could be a race condition where the TXFIFO
*   becomes empty before the new word is written. In that case the
*   transmission stops.
* - Auto CS with Manual or Auto Start: It is very difficult for software to
*   keep the TXFIFO filled. Whenever the TXFIFO runs empty, CS is deasserted.
*   This results in a single transaction to be split into multiple pieces each
*   with its own chip select. This will result in garbage data to be sent.
*
* <b>Interrupts</b>
*
* The user must connect the interrupt handler of the driver,
* XSpiPs_InterruptHandler, to an interrupt system such that it will be
* called when an interrupt occurs. This function does not save and restore
* the processor context such that the user must provide this processing.
*
* The driver handles the following interrupts:
* - Data Transmit Register/FIFO Underflow
* - Data Receive Register/FIFO Full
* - Data Receive Register/FIFO Not Empty
* - Data Transmit Register/FIFO Full
* - Data Transmit Register/FIFO Overwater
* - Mode Fault Error
* - Data Receive Register/FIFO Overrun
*
* The Data Transmit Register/FIFO Overwater interrupt -- indicates that the
* SPI device has transmitted the data available to transmit, and now its data
* register and FIFO is ready to accept more data. The driver uses this
* interrupt to indicate progress while sending data.  The driver may have
* more data to send, in which case the data transmit register and FIFO is
* filled for subsequent transmission. When this interrupt arrives and all
* the data has been sent, the driver invokes the status callback with a
* value of XST_SPI_TRANSFER_DONE to inform the upper layer software that
* all data has been sent.
*
* The Data Transmit Register/FIFO Underflow interrupt -- indicates that,
* as slave, the SPI device was required to transmit but there was no data
* available to transmit in the transmit register (or FIFO). This may not
* be an error if the master is not expecting data. But in the case where
* the master is expecting data, this serves as a notification of such a
* condition. The driver reports this condition to the upper layer
* software through the status handler.
*
* The Data Receive Register/FIFO Overrun interrupt -- indicates that the SPI
* device received data and subsequently dropped the data because the data
* receive register and FIFO was full. The interrupt applies to both master
* and slave operation. The driver reports this condition to the upper layer
* software through the status handler. This likely indicates a problem with
* the higher layer protocol, or a problem with the slave performance.
*
* The Mode Fault Error interrupt -- indicates that while configured as a
* master, the device was selected as a slave by another master. This can be
* used by the application for arbitration in a multimaster environment or to
* indicate a problem with arbitration. When this interrupt occurs, the
* driver invokes the status callback with a status value of
* XST_SPI_MODE_FAULT. It is up to the application to resolve the conflict.
* When configured as a slave, Mode Fault Error interrupt indicates that a slave
* device was selected as a slave by a master, but the slave device was
* disabled. When configured as a master, Mode Fault Error interrupt indicates
* that another SPI device is acting as a master on the bus.
*
*
* <b>Polled Operation</b>
*
* Transfer in polled mode is supported through a separate interface function
* XSpiPs_PolledTransfer(). Unlike the transfer function in the interrupt mode,
* this function blocks until all data has been sent/received.
*
* <b>Device Busy</b>
*
* Some operations are disallowed when the device is busy. The driver tracks
* whether a device is busy. The device is considered busy when a data transfer
* request is outstanding, and is considered not busy only when that transfer
* completes (or is aborted with a mode fault error). This applies to both
* master and slave devices.
*
* <b>Device Configuration</b>
*
* The device can be configured in various ways during the FPGA implementation
* process. Configuration parameters are stored in the xspips_g.c file or
* passed in via XSpiPs_CfgInitialize(). A table is defined where each entry
* contains configuration information for an SPI device, including the base
* address for the device.
*
* <b>RTOS Independence</b>
*
* This driver is intended to be RTOS and processor independent.  It works with
* physical addresses only.  Any needs for dynamic memory management, threads or
* thread mutual exclusion, virtual memory, or cache control must be satisfied
* by the layer above this driver.

/** @name Configuration options
 *
 * The following options are supported to enable/disable certain features of
 * an SPI device.  Each of the options is a bit mask, so more than one may be
 * specified.
 *
 * <b>The Master option</b> configures the SPI device as a master.
 * By default, the device is a slave.
 *
 * The <b>Active Low Clock option</b> configures the device's clock polarity.
 * Setting this option means the clock is active low and the SCK signal idles
 * high. By default, the clock is active high and SCK idles low.
 *
 * The <b>Clock Phase option</b> configures the SPI device for one of two
 * transfer formats.  A clock phase of 0, the default, means data is valid on
 * the first SCK edge (rising or falling) after the slave select (SS) signal
 * has been asserted. A clock phase of 1 means data is valid on the second SCK
 * edge (rising or falling) after SS has been asserted.
 *
 * The <b>Slave Select Decode Enable option</b> selects how the SPI_SS_outN are
 * controlled by the SPI Slave Select Decode bits.
 * 0: Use this setting for the standard configuration of up to three slave
 * select outputs. Only one of the three slave select outputs will be low.
 * (Default)
 * 1: Use this setting for the optional configuration of an additional decoder
 * to support 8 slave select outputs. SPI_SS_outN reflects the value in the
 * register.
 *
 * The <b>SPI Force Slave Select option</b> is used to enable manual control of
 * the signals SPI_SS_outN.
 * 0: The SPI_SS_outN signals are controlled by the SPI controller during
 * transfers. (Default)
 * 1: The SPI_SS_outN signal indicated by the Slave Select Control bit is
 * forced active (driven low) regardless of any transfers in progress.
 *
 * NOTE: The driver will handle setting and clearing the Slave Select when
 * the user sets the "FORCE_SSELECT_OPTION". Using this option will allow the
 * SPI clock to be set to a faster speed. If the SPI clock is too fast, the
 * processor cannot empty and refill the FIFOs before the TX FIFO is empty
 * When the SPI hardware is controlling the Slave Select signals, this
 * will cause slave to be de-selected and terminate the transfer.
 *
 * The <b>Manual Start option</b> is used to enable manual control of
 * the Start command to perform data transfer.
 * 0: The Start command is controlled by the SPI controller during
 * transfers(Default). Data transmission starts as soon as there is data in
 * the TXFIFO and stalls when the TXFIFO is empty
 * 1: The Start command must be issued by software to perform data transfer.
 * Bit 15 of Configuration register is used to issue Start command. This bit
 * must be set whenever TXFIFO is filled with new data.
 *
 * NOTE: The driver will set the Manual Start Enable bit in Configuration
 * Register, if Manual Start option is selected. Software will issue
 * Manual Start command whenever TXFIFO is filled with data. When there is
 * no further data, driver will clear the Manual Start Enable bit.
