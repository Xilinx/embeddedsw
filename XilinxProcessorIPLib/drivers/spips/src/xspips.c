* MODIFICATION HISTORY:
*
* Ver   Who    Date     Changes
* ----- ------ -------- -----------------------------------------------
* 1.00  drg/jz 01/25/10 First release
* 1.01	sg     03/07/12 Updated the code to always clear the relevant bits
*			before writing to config register.
*			Always clear the slave select bits before write and
*			clear the bits to no slave at the end of transfer
*			Modified the Polled transfer transmit/receive logic.
*			Tx should wait on TXOW Interrupt and Rx on RXNEMTY.
* 1.03	sg     09/21/12 Added memory barrier dmb in polled transfer and
*			interrupt handler to overcome the clock domain
*			crossing issue in the controller. For CR #679252.
* 1.04a	sg     01/30/13 Changed SPI transfer logic for polled and interrupt
*			modes to be based on filled tx fifo count and receive
*			based on it. RXNEMPTY interrupt is not used.
*			SetSlaveSelect API logic is modified to drive the bit
*			position low based on the slave select value
*			requested. GetSlaveSelect API will return the value
*			based on bit position that is low.
* 1.06a hk     08/22/13 Changed GetSlaveSelect function. CR# 727866.
*                       Added masking ConfigReg before writing in SetSlaveSel
*                       Added extended slave select support - CR#722569.
*                       Added check for MODF in polled transfer function.
* 3.00  kvn    02/13/15 Modified code for MISRA-C:2012 compliance.
* 3.02  raw    11/23/15 Updated XSpiPs_Abort() to read all RXFIFO entries.
* 			This change is to tackle CR#910231.
* 3.1	tjs    04/12/18 InputClockHz parameter copied in instance for use in
* 						application. CR#998910
* 3.1   tjs    11/23/18 Added a check for A72 and R5 processor to
*                       avoid changes made for the workaround DT#842463.
* 3.2	aru    01/20/19 Fixes violations according to MISRAC-2012
*                       in safety mode and done changes such as

*
* Transfers specified data on the SPI bus. If the SPI device is configured as
* a master, this function initiates bus communication and sends/receives the
* data to/from the selected SPI slave. If the SPI device is configured as a
* slave, this function prepares the buffers to be sent/received when selected
* by a master. For every byte sent, a byte is received. This function should
* be used to perform interrupt based transfers.
*
* The caller has the option of providing two different buffers for send and
* receive, or one buffer for both send and receive, or no buffer for receive.
* The receive buffer must be at least as big as the send buffer to prevent
* unwanted memory writes. This implies that the byte count passed in as an
* argument must be the smaller of the two buffers if they differ in size.
* Here are some sample usages:
* <pre>
*   XSpiPs_Transfer(InstancePtr, SendBuf, RecvBuf, ByteCount)
*	The caller wishes to send and receive, and provides two different
*	buffers for send and receive.
*
*   XSpiPs_Transfer(InstancePtr, SendBuf, NULL, ByteCount)
*	The caller wishes only to send and does not care about the received
*	data. The driver ignores the received data in this case.
*
*   XSpiPs_Transfer(InstancePtr, SendBuf, SendBuf, ByteCount)
*	The caller wishes to send and receive, but provides the same buffer
*	for doing both. The driver sends the data and overwrites the send
*	buffer with received data as it transfers the data.
*
*   XSpiPs_Transfer(InstancePtr, RecvBuf, RecvBuf, ByteCount)
*	The caller wishes to only receive and does not care about sending
*	data.  In this case, the caller must still provide a send buffer, but
*	it can be the same as the receive buffer if the caller does not care
*	what it sends.  The device must send N bytes of data if it wishes to
*	receive N bytes of data.
* </pre>
* Although this function takes entire buffers as arguments, the driver can only
* transfer a limited number of bytes at a time, limited by the size of the
* FIFO. A call to this function only starts the transfer, then subsequent
* transfers of the data is performed by the interrupt service routine until
* the entire buffer has been transferred. The status callback function is
* called when the entire buffer has been sent/received.
*
* This function is non-blocking. As a master, the SetSlaveSelect function must
* be called prior to this function.
*
* @param	InstancePtr is a pointer to the XSpiPs instance.
* @param	SendBufPtr is a pointer to a buffer of data for sending.
*		This buffer must not be NULL.
* @param	RecvBufPtr is a pointer to a buffer for received data.
*		This argument can be NULL if do not care about receiving.
* @param	ByteCount contains the number of bytes to send/receive.
*		The number of bytes received always equals the number of bytes
*		sent.
*
* @return
*		- XST_SUCCESS if the buffers are successfully handed off to the
*		device for transfer.
*		- XST_DEVICE_BUSY indicates that a data transfer is already in
*		progress. This is determined by the driver.

* This function is not thread-safe.  The higher layer software must ensure that
* no two threads are transferring data on the SPI bus at the same time.

*				application did not issue a transfer request
*				fast enough, or the processor/driver could not
*				fill the transmit register/FIFO fast enough.
*
* XST_SPI_RECEIVE_OVERRUN	The SPI device lost data. Data was received
*				but the receive data register/FIFO was full.
*
* XST_SPI_SLAVE_MODE_FAULT	A slave SPI device was selected as a slave

*				issues a transfer).

* The interrupts that are handled are:
*
* - Mode Fault Error. This interrupt is generated if this device is selected
*   as a slave when it is configured as a master. The driver aborts any data
*   transfer that is in progress by resetting FIFOs (if present) and resetting
*   its buffer pointers. The upper layer software is informed of the error.
*
* - Data Transmit Register (FIFO) Empty. This interrupt is generated when the
*   transmit register or FIFO is empty. The driver uses this interrupt during a
*   transmission to continually send/receive data until the transfer is done.
*
* - Data Transmit Register (FIFO) Underflow. This interrupt is generated when
*   the SPI device, when configured as a slave, attempts to read an empty
*   DTR/FIFO.  An empty DTR/FIFO usually means that software is not giving the
*   device data in a timely manner. No action is taken by the driver other than
*   to inform the upper layer software of the error.
*
* - Data Receive Register (FIFO) Overflow. This interrupt is generated when the
*   SPI device attempts to write a received byte to an already full DRR/FIFO.
*   A full DRR/FIFO usually means software is not emptying the data in a timely
*   manner.  No action is taken by the driver other than to inform the upper
*   layer software of the error.
*
* - Slave Mode Fault Error. This interrupt is generated if a slave device is
*   selected as a slave while it is disabled. No action is taken by the driver
*   other than to inform the upper layer software of the error.
*
* @param	InstancePtr is a pointer to the XSpiPs instance.
*
* @return	None.
*
* @note
*
* The slave select register is being set to deselect the slave when a transfer
* is complete.  This is being done regardless of whether it is a slave or a
* master since the hardware does not drive the slave select as a slave.
