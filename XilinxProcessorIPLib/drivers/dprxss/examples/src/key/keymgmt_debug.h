* The contents of this file adjust the definition of the PRINTF and DEBUG_LOG
* macros based on the presence/absence of a "FIDUS_BLAZY" definition from
* within xparameters.h.  It is assumed that is such a definition is present,
* then the console infrastructure will be part of the build.  Otherwise, the
