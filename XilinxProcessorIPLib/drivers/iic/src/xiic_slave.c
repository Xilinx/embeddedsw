* Contains slave functions for the XIic component. This file is necessary when

*
* <pre>
* MODIFICATION HISTORY:
*
* Ver   Who  Date     Changes
* ----- --- ------- -----------------------------------------------
* 1.01b jhl 3/26/02 repartioned the driver
* 1.01c ecm 12/05/02 new rev
* 1.13a wgr 03/22/07 Converted to new coding style.
* 1.15a ktn 03/18/09 Minor changes to comply to Doxygen
* 2.00a ktn 10/22/09 Converted all register accesses to 32 bit access.
*		     Updated to use the HAL APIs/macros.
*		     Removed the macro XIic_mEnterCriticalRegion and used
*		     XIic_IntrGlobalDisable int its place.
*		     Removed the macro XIic_mExitCriticalRegion and used
*		     XIic_IntrGlobalEnable in its place.
*		     Some of the macros have been renamed to remove _m from
*		     the name and some of the macros have been renamed to be
*		     consistent, see the xiic_i.h and xiic_l.h files for further
*		     information
* 2.03a rkv 01/25/11 Updated in NAAS interrupt handler to support data
*		     recieved less than FIFO size prior to NAAS interrupt.
*		     Fixed for CR590212.
* 2.04a sdm  07/22/11 Added IsSlaveSetAckOff flag to the instance structure.
*		      The IsSlaveSetAckOff is set when the Slave has set the
*		      Ack Off in the RecvSlaveData function and is cleared in the
*		      NotAddrAsSlaveHandler when the master has released the
*		      bus. This flag is to be used by slave applications for
*		      recovering when it has gone out of sync with the master.
*		      CR 615004.
* 3.1   adk  01/08/15 When configured as a slave return the actual number of
*		      bytes have been received/sent by the Master
*		      to the user callback (CR: 828504).

*    will not send a No Ack. It covers when the master fails to send No

* When the master is using repeated start:

*    master may want to write or read another message with this device.
*
* To prevent throttling, the slave must contine to read discard the data
* when the receive buffer is full. When unexpected bytes are received, No Ack
* must be set and the Rx buffer continually read until either NAAS
* or Bus Not Busy BND interrupt signals the master is no longer
* interacting with this slave. At this point the Ack is set to ON allowing
