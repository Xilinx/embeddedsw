* MODIFICATION HISTORY:
*
* Ver   Who  Date     Changes
* ----- --- ------- -----------------------------------------------
* 1.02a jvb  10/13/05 release
* 1.13a wgr  03/22/07 Converted to new coding style.
* 2.00a ktn  10/22/09 Converted all register accesses to 32 bit access.
*		      Updated to use the HAL APIs/macros.
*		      Some of the macros have been renamed to remove _m from
*		      the name and some of the macros have been renamed to be
*		      consistent, see the xiic_i.h and xiic_l.h files for further

*
* - Check the device has an entry in the configuration table.
* - Initialize the driver to allow access to the device registers and
*   initialize other subcomponents necessary for the operation of the device.
* - Default options to:
*     - 7-bit slave addressing
*     - Send messages as a slave device
*     - Repeated start off
*     - General call recognition disabled
* - Clear messageing and error statistics
*
* The XIic_Start() function must be called after this function before the device
* is ready to send and receive data on the IIC bus.
*
* Before XIic_Start() is called, the interrupt control must connect the ISR
* routine to the interrupt handler. This is done by the user, and not
* XIic_Start() to allow the user to use an interrupt controller of their choice.

*		application developer.

* @return

*		- XST_DEVICE_NOT_FOUND indicates the given device id isn't found
