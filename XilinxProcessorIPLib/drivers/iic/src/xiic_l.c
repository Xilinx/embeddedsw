* MODIFICATION HISTORY:
*
* Ver   Who  Date     Changes
* ----- --- -------   -----------------------------------------------
* 1.01b jhl 05/13/02  First release
* 1.01b jhl 10/14/02  Corrected bug in the receive function, the setup of the
*                     interrupt status mask was not being done in the loop such
*                     that a read would sometimes fail on the last byte because
*                     the transmit error which should have been ignored was
*                     being used.  This would leave an extra byte in the FIFO
*                     and the bus throttled such that the next operation would
*                     also fail.  Also updated the receive function to not
*                     disable the device after the last byte until after the
*                     bus transitions to not busy which is more consistent
*                     with the expected behavior.
* 1.01c ecm  12/05/02 new rev
* 1.02a mta  03/09/06 Implemented Repeated Start in the Low Level Driver.
* 1.03a mta  04/04/06 Implemented Dynamic IIC core routines.
* 1.03a ecm  06/15/06 Fixed the hang in low_level_eeprom_test with -O0
*                     Added polling loops for BNB to allow the slave to
*                     respond correctly. Also added polling loop prior
*                     to reset in _Recv.
* 1.13a wgr  03/22/07 Converted to new coding style.
* 1.13b ecm  11/29/07 added BB polling loops to the DynSend and DynRecv
*			routines to handle the race condition with BNB in IISR.
* 2.00a sdm  10/22/09 Converted all register accesses to 32 bit access.
*		      Updated to use the HAL APIs/macros.
*		      Some of the macros have been renamed to remove _m from
*		      the name and Some of the macros have been renamed to be
*		      consistent, see the xiic_i.h and xiic_l.h files for
*		      further information.
* 2.02a sdm  10/08/10 Updated to disable the device at the end of the transfer,
*		      only when addressed as slave in XIic_Send for CR565373.
* 2.04a sdm  07/22/11 Removed a compiler warning by adding parenthesis around &
*		      at line 479.
* 2.08a adk  29/07/13 In Low level driver In repeated start condition the
*		      Direction of Tx bit must be disabled in Receive
*		      condition It Fixes the CR:685759 Changes are done
*		      in the function XIic_Recv.
* 3.2   sk   11/10/15 Used UINTPTR instead of u32 for Baseaddress CR# 867425.
*                     Changed the prototypes of RecvData, SendData,
*                     DynRecvData, DynSendData APIs.
* 3.2	sd   18/02/16 In Low level driver in repeated start condition
*                     NACK for last byte is added. Changes are done in
*                     XIic_Recv for CR# 862303
* 3.3   sk   06/17/16 Added bus busy checks for slave send/recv and master
*                     send/recv.
* 3.3   als  06/27/16 Added Low-level XIic_CheckIsBusBusy API.
* 3.3   als  06/27/16 Added low-level XIic_WaitBusFree API.
* 3.4	nk   16/11/16 Reduced sleeping time in Bus-busy check.
