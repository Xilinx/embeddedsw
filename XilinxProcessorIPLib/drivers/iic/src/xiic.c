* MODIFICATION HISTORY:
*
* Ver   Who  Date     Changes
* ----- --- ------- -----------------------------------------------
* 1.01a rfp  10/19/01 release
* 1.01c ecm  12/05/02 new rev
* 1.01c rmm  05/14/03 Fixed diab compiler warnings relating to asserts.
* 1.01d jhl  10/08/03 Added general purpose output feature
* 1.02a jvb  12/13/05 Added CfgInitialize(), and made CfgInitialize() take
*                     a pointer to a config structure instead of a device id.
*                     Moved Initialize() into xiic_sinit.c, and have
*                     Initialize() call CfgInitialize() after it retrieved the
*                     config structure using the device id. Removed include of
*                     xparameters.h along with any dependencies on xparameters.h
*                     and the _g.c config table.
* 1.02a mta  03/09/06 Added a new function XIic_IsIicBusy() which returns
*			whether IIC Bus is Busy or Free.
* 1.13a wgr  03/22/07 Converted to new coding style.
* 1.15a ktn  02/17/09 Fixed XIic_GetAddress() to return correct device address.
* 1.16a ktn  07/18/09 Updated the notes in XIic_Reset function to clearly
*                     indicate that only the Interrupt Registers are reset.
* 1.16a ktn  10/16/09 Updated the notes in the XIic_SelfTest() API to mention
*                     that the complete IIC core is Reset on giving a software
*                     reset to the IIC core. This issue is fixed in the latest
*                     version of the IIC core (some previous versions of the
*                     core only reset the Interrupt Logic/Registers), please
*		      see the Hw specification for further information.
* 2.00a ktn  10/22/09 Converted all register accesses to 32 bit access.
*		      Some of the macros have been renamed to remove _m from
*		      the name see the xiic_i.h and xiic_l.h file for further
*		      information (Example XIic_mClearIntr is now
*		      XIic_ClearIntr).
*		      Some of the macros have been renamed to be consistent,
*		      see the xiic_l.h file for further information
*		      (Example XIIC_WRITE_IIER is renamed as XIic_WriteIier).
*		      The driver has been updated to use the HAL APIs/macros.
* 2.07a adk   18/04/13 Updated the code to avoid unused variable warnings
*			  when compiling with the -Wextra -Wall flags.
*			  Changes done if files xiic.c and xiic_i.h. CR:705001.
* 3.2   sk   11/10/15 Used UINTPTR instead of u32 for Baseaddress CR# 867425.
*                     Changed the prototype of XIic_CfgInitialize API.
* 3.3   als  06/27/16 XIic_IsIicBusy now static inline in xiic.h.
