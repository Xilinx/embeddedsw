* MODIFICATION HISTORY:
*
* Ver   Who  Date     Changes
* ----- --- ------- -----------------------------------------------
* 1.01b jhl 03/26/02 repartioned the driver
* 1.01c ecm 12/05/02 new rev
* 1.01c sv  05/09/05 Changed the data being written to the Address/Control
*                    Register and removed the code for testing the
*                    Receive Data Register.
* 1.13a wgr 03/22/07 Converted to new coding style.
* 1.16a ktn 07/17/09 Updated the test to test only Interrupt Registers
*		     as the software reset only resets the interrupt logic
*		     and the Interrupt Registers are set to default values.
* 1.16a ktn 10/16/09 Updated the notes in the XIic_SelfTest() API and
*                    XIIC_RESET macro to mention that the complete IIC core
*                    is Reset on giving a software reset to the IIC core.
*                    Some previous versions of the core only reset the
*                    Interrupt Logic/Registers, please refer to the HW
*                    specification for futher details.
* 2.00a ktn 10/22/09 Converted all register accesses to 32 bit access.
*		     Updated to use the HAL APIs/macros.
*		     Some of the macros have been renamed to remove _m from
*		     the name and some of the macros have been renamed to be
*		     consistent, see the xiic_i.h and xiic_l.h files for further
*		     information
