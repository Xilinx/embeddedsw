* @file xiic_multi_master_example.c
*
* This file consists of a Interrupt mode design example which uses the Xilinx
* IIC device and XIic driver to exercise the EEPROM on the Xilinx boards in a
* Multi master mode. This example has been tested with an off-board external
* IIC Master connected on the IIC bus.
*
* This example writes/reads from the lower 256 bytes of the IIC EEPROMS. Please
* refer to the datasheets of the IIC EEPROM's for details about the internal
* addressing and page size of these devices.
*
* The XIic_MasterSend() API is used to transmit the data and XIic_MasterRecv()
* API is used to receive the data.
*
* The example is tested on ML300/ML310/ML403/ML501 Xilinx boards.
*
* The ML310/ML410/ML510 boards have a on-board 64 Kb serial IIC EEPROM
* (Microchip 24LC64A). The WP pin of the IIC EEPROM is hardwired to ground on
* this board.
*
* The ML300 board has an on-board 32 Kb serial IIC EEPROM(Microchip 24LC32A).
* The WP pin of the IIC EEPROM has to be connected to ground for this example.
* The WP is connected to pin Y3 of the FPGA.
*
* The ML403 board has an on-board 4 Kb serial IIC EEPROM(Microchip 24LC04A).
* The WP pin of the IIC EEPROM is hardwired to ground on this board.
*
* The ML501/ML505/ML507/ML605/SP601/SP605 boards have an on-board 8 Kb serial
* IIC EEPROM(STM M24C08). The WP pin of the IIC EEPROM is hardwired to
* ground on these boards.
*
* The AddressType for ML300/ML310/ML410/ML510 boards should be u16 as the
* address pointer in the on board EEPROM is 2 bytes.
*
* The AddressType for ML403/ML501/ML505/ML507/ML605/SP601/SP605 boards should
* be u8 as the address pointer for the on board EEPROM is 1 byte.
*
* The 7 bit IIC Slave address of the IIC EEPROM on the ML300/ML310/ML403/ML410/
* ML501/ML505/ML507/ML510 boards is 0x50.
* The 7 bit IIC Slave address of the IIC EEPROM on the ML605/SP601/SP605 boards
* is 0x54.
* Refer to the User Guide's of the respective boards for further information
* about the IIC slave address of IIC EEPROM's.
*
* The define EEPROM_ADDRESS in this file needs to be changed depending on
* the board on which this example is to be run.
* This code assumes that no Operating System is being used.
*
* @note
*
* None.
*
* <pre>
* MODIFICATION HISTORY:
*
* Ver   Who  Date	 Changes
* ----- ---- -------- -----------------------------------------------
* 1.00a mta  03/01/06 Created.
* 2.00a sdm  09/22/09 Converted all register accesses to 32 bit access.
*		      Updated to use the HAL APIs, replaced call to
*		      XIic_Initialize API with XIic_LookupConfig and
*		      XIic_CfgInitialize.
* 2.01a ktn  03/17/10 Updated the information about the EEPROM's used on
*		      ML605/SP601/SP605 boards.
* 3.4   ms   01/23/17 Added xil_printf statement in main function to
*                     ensure that "Successfully ran" and "Failed" strings
*                     are available in all examples. This is a fix for
*                     CR-965028.
