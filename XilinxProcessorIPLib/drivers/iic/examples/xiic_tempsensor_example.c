* @file xiic_tempsensor_example.c
*
* This file contains an interrupt based design example which uses the Xilinx
* IIC device and driver to exercise the temperature sensor on the ML300 board.
* This example only performs read operations (receive) from the IIC temperature
* sensor of the platform.
*
* The XIic_MasterRecv() API is used to receive the data.
*
* This example assumes that there is an interrupt controller in the hardware
* system and the IIC device is connected to the interrupt controller.
*
* @note
*
* 7-bit addressing is used to access the tempsensor.
