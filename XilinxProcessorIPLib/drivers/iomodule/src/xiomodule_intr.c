*
* This file contains the interrupt processing for the XIOModule component
* which is the driver for the Xilinx IO Module interrupt.  The interrupt
* processing is partitioned seperately such that users are not required to
* use the provided interrupt processing.  This file requires other files of
* the driver to be linked in also.
*
* Two different interrupt handlers are provided for this driver such that the
* user must select the appropriate handler for the application.  The first
* interrupt handler, XIOModule_VoidInterruptHandler, is provided for
* systems which use only a single interrupt controller or for systems that
* cannot otherwise provide an argument to the XIOModule interrupt handler
* (e.g., the RTOS interrupt vector handler may not provide such a facility).
* The constant XPAR_IOMODULE_SINGLE_DEVICE_ID must be defined for this
* handler to be included in the driver.  The second interrupt handler,
* XIOModule_InterruptHandler, uses an input argument which is an instance
* pointer to an interrupt controller driver such that multiple interrupt
* controllers can be supported.  This handler requires the calling function
* to pass it the appropriate argument, so another level of indirection may be
* required.
*
* Note that both of these handlers are now only provided for backward
* compatibility. The handler defined in xiomodule_l.c is the recommended
* handler.
*
* The interrupt processing may be used by connecting one of the interrupt
* handlers to the interrupt system.  These handlers do not save and restore
* the processor context but only handle the processing of the Interrupt
* Controller.  The two handlers are provided as working examples. The user is
* encouraged to supply their own interrupt handler when performance tuning is
* deemed necessary.
*

* ----- ---- -------- ---------------------------------------------------------
* 1.00a sa   07/15/11 First release
* 1.02a sa   07/25/12 Added UART interrupt related functions
* 1.03a sa   10/16/12 Moved UART interrupt related functions to separate file

*
* @internal
*
* This driver assumes that the context of the processor has been saved prior to
* the calling of the IO Module interrupt handler and then restored
* after the handler returns. This requires either the running RTOS to save the
* state of the machine or that a wrapper be used as the destination of the
* interrupt vector to save the state of the processor and restore the state
* after the interrupt handler returns.
