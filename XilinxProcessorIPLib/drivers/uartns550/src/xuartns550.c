* MODIFICATION HISTORY:
*
* Ver   Who  Date     Changes
* ----- ---- -------- -----------------------------------------------
* 1.00a ecm  08/16/01 First release
* 1.00b jhl  03/11/02 Repartitioned driver for smaller files.
* 1.00b rmm  05/14/03 Fixed diab compiler warnings relating to asserts.
* 1.01a jvb  12/13/05 I changed Initialize() into CfgInitialize(), and made
*                     CfgInitialize() take a pointer to a config structure
*                     instead of a device id. I moved Initialize() into
*                     xgpio_sinit.c, and had Initialize() call CfgInitialize()
*                     after it retrieved the config structure using the device
*                     id. I removed include of xparameters.h along with any
*                     dependencies on xparameters.h and the _g.c config table.
* 1.11a sv   03/20/07 Updated to use the new coding guidelines.
* 2.00a ktn  10/20/09 Converted all register accesses to 32 bit access.
*		      Updated to use HAL Processor APIs. _m is removed from the
*		      name of all the macro definitions. XUartNs550_mClearStats
*		      macro is removed, XUartNs550_ClearStats function should be
*		      used in its place.
* 2.01a bss  01/13/12 Removed unneccessary read of the LCR register in the
*                     XUartNs550_CfgInitialize function. Removed compiler
*		      warnings for unused variables in the
*		      XUartNs550_StubHandler.
* 3.3	nsk  04/13/15 Fixed Clock Divisor Enhancement.
*		      (CR 857013)
* 3.4   sk   11/10/15 Used UINTPTR instead of u32 for Baseaddress CR# 867425.
*                     Changed the prototype of XUartNs550_CfgInitialize API.
