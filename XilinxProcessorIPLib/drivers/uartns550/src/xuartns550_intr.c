* This file contains the functions that are related to interrupt processing
* for the 16450/16550 UART driver.
*
* <pre>
* MODIFICATION HISTORY:
*
* Ver   Who  Date     Changes
* ----- ---- -------- -----------------------------------------------
* 1.00b jhl  03/11/02 Repartitioned driver for smaller files.
* 1.11a sv   03/20/07 Updated to use the new coding guidelines.
* 2.00a ktn  10/20/09 Converted all register accesses to 32 bit access.
*		      Updated to use HAL Processor APIs. _m is removed from the
*		      name of all the macro definitions. XUartNs550_mClearStats
*		      macro is removed, XUartNs550_ClearStats function should be
*		      used in its place.
* 2.02a adk 09/16/13 Updated the ReceiveDataHandler function to be the same as
*                     ReceiveTimeoutHandler.  The ReceiveTimeoutHandler will
*		      call the callback function with XUN_EVENT_RECV_TIMEOUT when
*		      there is data received which is less than the requested
*		      data (this will also happen for the case where the
*		      data is equal to the threshold).
*		      The callback function with XUN_EVENT_RECV_DATA will be
*		      called when all the requested data has been received
* </pre>
