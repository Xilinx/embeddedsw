* @details
*
* This header file contains layer 2 API's of the deint sub-core driver.
* The functions contained herein provides a high level implementation of features
* provided by the IP, abstracting away the register level details from
* the user
*
* <b>Deinterlacer IP Features </b>
*
* Currently only 1080i input is supported
*
* <b>Dependency</b>
*
* This driver makes use of the video enumerations and data types defined in the
* Xilinx Video Common Driver (video_common_vX.x) and as such the common driver
* must be included as dependency to compile this driver
*
* <b>Initialization & Configuration</b>
*
* The device driver enables higher layer software (e.g., an application) to
* communicate to the deint core.
*
* Before using the layer-2 API's user must initialize the core by calling
* Layer-1 API XV_deinterlacer_Initialize(). This function will look for a
* configuration structure for the device and initialize it to defined HW
* settings. After initialization Layer-2 API's can be used to configure
* the core. It is recommended user always make use of Layer-2 API to interact
* with core.
* Advanced users always have the capability to directly interact with the
* core using Layer-1 API's that perform low level register peek/poke.
*
* <b> Interrupts </b>
*
* This driver does not have any interrupts
*
* <b> Virtual Memory </b>
*
* This driver supports Virtual Memory. The RTOS is responsible for calculating
* the correct device base address in Virtual Memory space.
*
* <b> Threads </b>
*
* This driver is not thread safe. Any needs for threads or thread mutual
* exclusion must be satisfied by the layer above this driver.
*

* MODIFICATION HISTORY:
*
* Ver   Who    Date     Changes
* ----- ---- -------- -------------------------------------------------------
* 5.00  rco   07/21/15   Initial Release
* 6.00  rco   11/05/15   Integrate layer-1 with layer-2
*       dmc   02/25/16   add public routine XV_DeintWaitForIdle()
* 6.1   rco   11/07/16   Fix for c++ compile
