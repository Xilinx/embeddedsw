embeddedsw.git - repo for standalone software

All software is version less and divided into three directories
	- lib 
		contains bsp, zynq fsbl and software services like xilisf
	- license.txt
		contains information about the various licenses and copyrights
	- XilinxProcessorIPLib
		contains all drivers
	- ThirdParty
		software from third party like light weight IP stack
	- mcap
		software for using MCAP interface on Ultra Scale boards to
		program 2nd level bitstream

Every driver/lib/apps/services has these sub-directories

1. data		- contains tcl, mdd, testapp tcl or header files used in SDK
2. doc		- documentation of source code in form of pdf or html 
3. examples	- illustrating different use cases of driver
4. src		- driver interface code implementing functionality of IP

Building FSBL from git:

FSBL has 3 directories.
	1. data - It contains files for SDK
	2. src  - It contains the FSBL source files
	3. misc - It contains miscelanious files required to 
		  compile FSBL for zc702, zc706, zed and 
		  microzed boards.
		  It also contains the ps7_init_gpl.[c/h] with gpl 
		  header in respective board directories.
		

How to compile FSBL:
	1.Go to the Fsbl src directory "lib/sw_apps/zynq_fsbl/src/"
	2. make "BOARD=<>" "CC=<>"
		a. Values for BOARD  are zc702, zc706, zed, microzed
		b. Value for CC is arm-xilinx-eabi-gcc. Default value is also same.
	3.Give "make" to compile the fsbl with BSP. By default it is 
	  built for zc702 board with arm-xilinx-eabi-gcc compiler
	4.Below are the examples for compiling for different options
		a. To generate Fsbl for zc706 board 
			i.make "BOARD=zc706"
		b.To generate Fsbl for zc702 board with debug enable 
		  and RSA support
			i.make "BOARD=zc702" "CFLAGS=-DFSBL_DEBUG_INFO -DRSA_SUPPORT"
		c.To generate Fsbl for zc706 board and compile with arm-xilinx-eabi-gcc
		  with MMC support 
			i.make "BOARD=zc706" "CC=arm-xilinx-eabi-gcc" "CFLAGS=-DMMC_SUPPORT"
